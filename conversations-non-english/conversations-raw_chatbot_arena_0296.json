If it's持续很久或者影响到你的日常生活， you might want to talk to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, friend, or a mental health professional. They can help you understand what's going on and provide support and guidance. If you don't know anyone who you can trust, you might want to consider reaching out to a local mental health center or a crisis hotline. They can provide you with the help you need while you wait for a chance to talk to someone."
