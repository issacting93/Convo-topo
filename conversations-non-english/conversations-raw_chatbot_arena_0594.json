      "content": "There are many healthy and sugar-free foods that taste sweet. Some examples are:\n\n- Sweet potatoes\n- Bananas\n- Apples\n- Pears\n- Nuts\n- Dairy products such as milk and yogurt\n\nIt is important to note that natural sugars found in fruits and vegetables are different from added sugars, which are usually found in processed foods. Consuming added sugars can lead to increased blood sugar levels, which can lead to health problems such as diabetes. It is best to limit your consumption of added sugars to less than 10% of your total daily calories."
