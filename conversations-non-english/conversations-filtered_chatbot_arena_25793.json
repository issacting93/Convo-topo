The ants will respond to the presence of beacons.\n \tRules\nThe game is played in turns. On each turn, both players perform any number of actions simultaneously.\nThe Map\nOn each run, the map is generated randomly and is made up of hexagonal cells.\n\nEach cell has an index and up to six neighbors. Each direction is labelled 0 to 5.\n\nHex directions\n\nEach cell has a type, which indicates what the cell contains:\n0 if it does not contain a resource.\n1 if it contains the egg resource.\n2 if it contains the crystal resource.\nThe amount of resources contained in each cell is also given, and is subject to change during the game as the ants harvest cells.\n\nA cell may also have a base on it. The players’ ants will start the game on these bases.\n\nBlue base\n\nEgg\nAnts & Beacons\nBoth players start with several ants placed on their bases. The players cannot move the ants directly but can place beacons to affect their movement.\n\nPlayers can place any number of beacons per turn but can only place one each per cell.\n\nWhen placing a beacon, players must give that beacon a strength. These beacon strengths act as weights, determining the proportion of ants that will be dispatched to each one.\n\nIn other words, the higher the beacon strength, the greater the percentage of your ants that will be sent to that beacon.\n\nExample\nIn the following example, there are three beacons of strength 2,1, and 2.\n\n\nWhite numbers in a colored diamond represent the ants. Here, 10 ants in total will be dispatched to the beacons.\n\nThe 10 ants will move to the three beacons, keeping the same proportions as the beacon strengths.\n\nThe ants will do their best to take the shortest paths to their designated beacons, moving at a speed of one cell per turn.\n\nIn between turns, the existing beacons are powered down and removed from play.\n\nUse beacons to place your ants in such a way to create harvesting chains between your bases and a resource.\n\nHarvesting Chains\nIn order to harvest crystal and score points, there must be an uninterrupted chain of cells containing your ants between the resource and your bases.\n\nThe amount of crystal harvested per turn is equal to the weakest link in the chain. In other words, it is the smallest amount of ants from the ce"

You cannot directly control the ants, but instead place beacons that attract ants towards them.\n\nThe game is turn-based. On each turn, you and your opponent place beacons and the ants respond to them. \n\nThe map is randomly generated with hexagonal cells. Cells contain resources like eggs or crystals, or they can be empty. Your ants start on your base cell.\n\nYou place beacons by specifying a beacon strength. Higher strength attracts a higher percentage of your ants. After each turn, beacons are removed.\n\nIn order to harvest crystals from a cell, you must have an uninterrupted chain of ants connecting that cell to your base. The amount of crystal harvested per turn depends on the weakest link in the ant chain.\n\nThe goal is to harvest more crystals than your opponent by the end of the game by strategically placing beacons to form harvesting chains."

In other words, it is the smallest amount of ants from the cells that make up the chain.\n\n\nHere, the blue player will harvest 4 crystal per turn.\n\nIn games with multiple bases per player, the game will choose the best chain to either one of your bases.\n\nThe harvesting chains work the same way for the egg resource.\n\nHarvesting an egg cell will spawn as many ants as resources havested. The ants will spawn on the player’s base on the start of next turn. In games with multiple bases per player, the extra ants will spawn on each base, regardless of the base present in the harvest chain.\n\nHarvesting is calculated separately for each resource, and for each one the game will automatically choose the best chain from its cell to your base.\n\nAttack Chains\nA player’s harvest chains may be broken by their opponent’s attack chains.\n\nWhen computing harvest chains, some cells may have ants from both players. For each of these cells, the attack chain of both players is computed, and if one of the player has a lower value, this cell cannot be counted in the harvest chain.\n\nThe attack chain value for a given cell is the weakest link in a chain from that cell to one of the player’s bases.\nExample\n\nThe attack chains for the contested cell are: 5 for the red player and 3 for the blue player.\nThe harvest chain is unbroken.\n\nThe attack chains for the contested cell are: 5 for the red player and 8 for the blue player.\nThe harvest chain is broken.\nActions\nOn each turn players can do any amount of valid actions, which include:\n\nBEACON index strength: place a beacon of strength strength on cell index.\nLINE index1 index2 strength: place beacons all along a path from index1 to index2, all of strength strength. A shortest path is chosen automatically.\nWAIT: do nothing.\nMESSAGE text. Displays text on your side of the HUD.\nAction order for one turn\nLINE actions are computed.\nBEACON actions are computed.\nAnts move.\nEggs are harvested and new ants spawn.\nCrystal is harvested and points are scored.\n\nNote: when two players harvest from the same resource, they will both receive the full expected amount regardless of whether there is enough resource to support it.\nVictory Conditions\nYou have harvested at least half of the total crystal on the map before your opponent.\nYou have more crystal than your opponent after 100 turns, or more ants if tied.\nDefeat Conditions\nYour program does not provide a command in the allotted time or it provides an unrecognized c"

      "content": "Here are some strategies to consider for this game:\n\n1. Focus on crystal cells near your base. Place beacons near crystal cells that are close to your base to form harvesting chains quickly. Try to claim these cells before your opponent.\n\n2. Defend your harvesting chains. Place beacons to form attack chains near cells in your harvesting chains to defend them from your opponent's ants. The higher your attack chain value, the more secure the cell.\n\n3. Break your opponent's chains. Try to place beacons to form attack chains that are stronger than your opponent's harvesting chains. This can break their chains and prevent them from harvesting resources.\n\n4. Use egg cells strategically. Harvesting eggs spawns new ants that can reinforce your attack and harvesting chains. Focus eggs cells near important resource cells or your base. \n\n5. Expand outwards. Once you have secured crystal cells near your base, expand outwards to claim more distant resources. Use LINE actions to place beacons along long paths efficiently.\n\n6. Monitor your opponent. Pay attention to where your opponent is placing beacons and attacking. React by defending your chains or breaking theirs.\n\n7. Balance expansion and defense. Don't overextend your attack chains if it leaves your base undefended. Balance expanding to claim new resources with defending your existing harvest chains.\n\n8. Reserve ants. Don't place beacons that attract all your ants if you may need some in reserve to react to your opponent. Leave some flexibility in your strategy.\n\n9. Monitor the score. As the game progresses, pay attention to the score and your progress towards your win condition. Adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n10. Experiment! Try different strategies during the game to see what works and what doesn't. Adapt and improve your strategy over time. Have fun!"

      "content": "Here is a simple example solution:\n```\nwhile True:\n    # Claim crystal cells near our base\n    BEACON 0 3\n    BEACON 1 2\n    \n    # Defend our chains    \n    BEACON 0 1\n    BEACON 1 1\n    \n    # Expand outwards\n    if myAnts > 50:\n        LINE 0 10 5\n        \n    # Wait if we have no actions    \n    WAIT\n```\n\nThis code will:\n\n- Place beacons of strength 3 near any crystal cells (index 0 and 1) close to our base  \n- Defend those cells by placing beacons of strength 1 nearby   \n- Once we have over 50 ants, expand outwards by placing beacons along a path from our base (index 0) to cell 10\n- Use WAIT if we have no other actions\n\nThis is a very basic strategy that focuses on:\n\n1. Claiming nearby resource cells \n2. Defending our harvesting chains  \n3. Expanding outwards once we have enough ants\n\nWe could improve this strategy by:\n\n- Monitoring our opponent's beacons and breaking their chains\n- Using egg cells to spawn more ants for defense or expansion  \n- Increasing the beacon strengths based on the number of ants we have\n- Adding logic to respond to different game situations  \n\nAnd of course, this simple example only demonstrates the structure of an possible solution - the actual strategy and actions would depend on the specific details of the game!\n\nThe main takeaways are:\n\n- Claim nearby resources \n- Defend your harvesting chains\n- Expand outwards over time  \n- Adapt your strategy based on the game state\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

      "content": "Some useful algorithms for this game could include:\n\n- Shortest path algorithms: To efficiently place LINE beacons between distant cells. Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search could be used.\n\n- Greedy resource selection: To identify the highest priority resource cells to claim based on factors like distance, resource amount, and opponent presence.\n\n- Threat assessment: To identify opponent beacons that threaten your harvest chains and should be targeted. This could use graph algorithms to find paths between opponent beacons and your cells.\n\n- Monte Carlo tree search: To simulate possible future game states and identify the best actions to take. This could help with strategic decisions like when to expand or defend.\n\n- Minimax search: A simpler search algorithm to evaluate the best and worst case outcomes of possible actions. This could help decide between alternative moves.\n\n- Heuristics: Simple rules of thumb to guide your strategy, like prioritizing closer resources, defending vulnerable chains, etc. These reduce the search space and complexity.\n\n- Greedy beacon placement: Placing beacons in a way that maximizes the attraction of ants, either by covering the most cells or cells with the most resources.\n\n- Ant pathfinding: To determine the shortest paths ants will take to reach beacons, which may not be a straight line between cells. This ensures your strategy is based on realistic ant movement.\n\nIn general, graph algorithms will be useful due to the map layout and need to find paths between cells. Search algorithms can help evaluate alternative moves and strategies. Heuristics can simplify the problem and guide your strategy.\n\nThe specific algorithms you use will depend on the performance requirements and complexity of your solution. But these types of algorithms are well suited to the challenges in this game.\n\nHope this gives you some ideas! Let me know if you have any other questions."
