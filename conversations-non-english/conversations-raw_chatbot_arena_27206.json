      "content": "A haiku is a type of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a syllable count of 5-7-5. The haiku follows a specific structure of a seasonal word (kigo) in the first line, a break (ku) in the second line, and a seasonal reference in the third line. Haiku is known for its simplicity, directness, and focus on nature."
