This gives us an estimate of how much time has been spent on the task so far.</li><li>The function calculates the duration of the task by multiplying the remaining time (1 - the percentage of the task that has already been completed) by the current time. This gives us an estimate of how much time is still required to complete the task.</li><li>The function then returns the ETA and duration.</li></ol><p>Here's an example of how you might use this function:</p><pre><div><div>Copy code</div><div><code><span># Calculate the ETA and duration of a task</span>\ncurrent_time = 10\npercentage = 0.5\neta, duration = eta_and_duration(current_time, percentage)  <span># ETA: 5 hours and duration: 3 hours</span>\n</code></div></div></pre><p>I hope this helps!
