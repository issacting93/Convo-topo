      "content": "Tidal forces are the力量 of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's surface that cause the Earth's water levels to rise and fall. These forces are caused by the Moon's gravitational pull on the Earth, which causes the Earth's water to be attracted to the Moon and to be stored in the Earth's oceans. At the same time, the Sun's gravitational pull on the Earth also causes the Earth's water to be attracted to the Sun and to be released into the atmosphere as sunlight. This process, which is called \"tidalidal\" or \"tidal water,\" causes the Earth's water levels to rise and fall, which is what we call tides."

      "content": "There are actually three high tides each day, but they are called \"high\" tide because they are the highest water levels that can be seen on the ocean surface. The period between the two high tides is called the \"low tide,\" and it is the lowest water level that can be seen on the ocean surface. The reason for the existence of these tides is the same as the reason for the existence of tides on Earth in general: the Moon's gravitational pull on the Earth causes the Earth's water levels to rise and fall, and the Sun's gravitational pull on the Earth also causes the Earth's water to be attracted to the Sun and to be released into the atmosphere as sunlight. This process causes the Earth's water levels to rise and fall, which is what we call tides."
