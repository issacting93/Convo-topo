Animal agriculture is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water pollution, so choosing a vegan diet can have a positive impact on the environment. Vegans can get all the nutrients they need from plant-based foods, and there is no evidence to suggest that vegans are dangerous or pose a threat to animals or the environment."
