If they saw 0, 1, or 2 black hats, they knew they must have the third black hat. If they saw 3 black hats, they knew they must have a white hat.\n\nFor example, if one prisoner saw 0 black hats, one saw 1 black hat, and the third saw 2 black hats, they would know that they had the third black hat.\n\nBy deductive reasoning, each prisoner was able to determine which color hat they had and could confidently state that they had a black hat."

In this case, the answer to the riddle is that the prisoners were able to determine which color hat they had by the way the other two prisoners reacted when each of them put on their hat.\n\nSince each prisoner only saw the hats of the other two, they couldn't see their own hat. However, when they put on their hat, they would have seen the reactions of the other two prisoners.\n\nIf one of the prisoners had a white hat, the other two would have seen that and would have looked surprised or confused. In this case, the prisoner with the white hat would have been able to deduce that they had a black hat.\n\nOn the other hand, if all three prisoners had black hats, they would have looked identical to the other two prisoners, and each of them would have seen the other two looking identical as well. In this case, each prisoner would have known that they had a black hat.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer is that the prisoners were able to determine which color hat they had by observing the reactions of the other two prisoners when they put on their hat."
