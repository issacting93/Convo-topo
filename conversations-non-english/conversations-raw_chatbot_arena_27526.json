      "content": "In the movie \"Shrek,\" the character Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is a large, green, ogre who lives in a swamp and is known for being anti-social and grumpy. At the beginning of the movie, Shrek is confronted by a group of fairy tale characters who have been banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad.\n\nFarquaad, who is short and has a pompous attitude, orders Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz) from a dragon-guarded castle so that he can marry her and become king. Shrek reluctantly agrees to go on the quest, accompanied by a talking donkey named Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy).\n\nAlong the way, Shrek and Donkey encounter various challenges and obstacles, including fighting against Farquaad's army and facing off against a fire-breathing dragon. Eventually, they arrive at the castle and rescue Fiona from the dragon, who is revealed to be Fiona's mother in disguise.\n\nAs for who kills Farquaad, it is not explicitly shown in the movie. However, in the sequel \"Shrek 2,\" it is revealed that Farquaad's father, King Harold (also voiced by John Lithgow), had murdered him in his sleep after Farquaad's marriage to Fiona."

      "content": "The Gingerbread Man is a popular children's storybook character who first appeared in a book written and illustrated by Paul Galdone in 1975. The story follows a mischievous gingerbread man who comes to life and escapes from the oven, running away from various animals who want to eat him.\n\nIn the story, the Gingerbread Man's legs do not go missing. However, he does encounter various obstacles and challenges as he tries to evade his hungry pursuers, such as jumping over rivers and dodging foxes and bears. Eventually, the Gingerbread Man is captured and eaten by a group of hungry farm animals, but not before he has a chance to warn them about the dangers of being eaten by humans.\n\nThe story of the Gingerbread Man has been adapted into various forms of media, including films, TV shows, and video games, but the general plot and themes of the story remain the same."

      "content": "In the story of the Gingerbread Man, the character does not get his legs back after they are eaten by the farm animals. The story ends with the Gingerbread Man being fully consumed and no longer having any legs.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the story of the Gingerbread Man is a fictional children's tale, and the events and characters depicted in it are not meant to be taken literally. The story is often used as a way to teach young children about the dangers of running away from problems or disobeying authority figures, as well as the consequences of one's actions."

In the original story, the Gingerbread Man's legs are eaten by various animals, and he is eventually consumed entirely.\n\nIf you are referring to a different version of the story or a related story that involves candy cane legs, please let me know and I will do my best to provide an answer."
