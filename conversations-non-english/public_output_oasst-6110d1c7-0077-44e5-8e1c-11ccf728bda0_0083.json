      "content": "There is no concrete evidence to support the claim. While it is a common belief, the reality is that many inventors and innovators were working on similar devices at the time. While Edison played a significant role in the commercialization of the light bulb, he built on the work of many other inventors who had been working on similar devices for decades. Edison was indeed the first person to develop a practical and commercially viable light bulb.\n\nThe idea that Edison stole Tesla's idea may have been popularized by various myths and rumours that have been circulating for over a century. People may believe this because Tesla is often associated with electricity and innovation, and because he had some disagreements with Edison in the past. However, Tesla and Edison were not bitter enemies as some people may believe. While they did have some differences and disagreements, they also had a certain degree of respect for each other."

      "content": "The episode \"Nikola Tesla's Night of Terror\" depicts Nikola Tesla's and Thomas Edison's relationship in a somewhat accurate manner, but it takes some creative liberties for dramatic purposes. While the two inventors did have a professional rivalry, their relationship was not as antagonistic as portrayed in the episode.\n\nIn reality, Tesla and Edison did have different approaches to inventing, with Tesla focusing on more theoretical and scientific concepts while Edison was more focused on practical applications. However, they did work together briefly in the 1880s when Tesla was employed by Edison's company, and they did have mutual respect for each other's work.\n\nThe episode also portrays Edison as being solely focused on profit and stealing Tesla's ideas, which is not entirely accurate. While Edison was known for his business acumen and could be ruthless in protecting his patents, he also had a genuine interest in science and invention.\n\nOverall, while the episode takes some liberties with historical accuracy, it does capture the essence of the professional rivalry between Tesla and Edison, and the struggle for recognition and success in the world of invention."

      "content": "It is not true. It is correct that Thomas Edison wasn't the first to think of or invent an electric lamp, but the one to make the light bulb more commercially viable and the first to successfully bring it to market. However, Nikola Tesla was not involved in the lightbulb.\nDespite his contribution, what Edison actually did in history still contrasts strongly with his well-known inventor stories and makes many people consider him as an liar. Meanwhile, Tesla's less-known innovations in electricity distribution, radio, wireless power, etc. together with his \"mad-scientist\" rumors makes him the \"forgotten selfless inventor\". Though there is no evidence that they deeply hate each other, their ideolgies did clash fiercely in the War of the Currents between the Westinghouse and Edison companies. The idea of a feud between them involving stealing patents, lies, and sabotages also began to get popularity in literature, movies, games, .etc. Therefore, it is very common that people will consider contributions related to Edison to be stolen from Tesla."

      "content": "The rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla has been portrayed in various popular media, often referred to as the \"War of the Currents.\" The conflict arose from their competing electrical systems: Edison's direct current (DC) and Tesla's alternating current (AC). The feud has inspired numerous books, documentaries, movies, and TV shows, some of which are:\n\n- The Prestige (2006) \u2013 A film directed by Christopher Nolan, based on a novel of the same name by Christopher Priest. While Edison and Tesla are not the main characters, the rivalry between them is a subplot that influences the main story.\n- The Current War (2017) \u2013 A historical drama film directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, focusing on the competition between Edison and Tesla, as well as George Westinghouse, in the race to power the United States with electricity.\n- Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World (2003) \u2013 A book by Jill Jonnes that focuses on the \"War of the Currents\" and the larger-than-life personalities involved.\n- Tesla (2020) \u2013 A biographical drama film directed by Michael Almereyda, focusing on Tesla's life and his rivalry with Edison.\n- Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla (1996) \u2013 A biography by Marc J. Seifer that delves into Tesla's life, inventions, and rivalry with Edison.\n\nThe fascination with the Edison-Tesla rivalry is fueled by the significant contributions both inventors made to the field of electricity, as well as their contrasting personalities and approaches to innovation. Edison, known for his persistence and practicality, is often portrayed as a ruthless businessman, while Tesla, a visionary inventor and advocate for AC power, is depicted as a misunderstood genius."

      "content": "The rivalry of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla is a well known fact and therefore has been depicted in a variety of media. The rivalry is based a series of historical  events which is nowadays known as \"War of the Currents.\" During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the two inventors and their respective companies were competing each other with their own electrical power transmission systems. Edison advocated direct current (DC) while Tesla, along with George Westinghouse, promoted alternating current (AC). Their competition with these systems and the inventors became highly famous, since their innovative impact on society and the electrical industry is considered to be of an immense magnitude. Their historical relevance has lead to a large variety of portrayals, also in popular media.\nSee a some examples regarding popular media on this topic:\n\n- **The Prestige** (2006) - Directed by Christopher Nolan. Mainly focusing on the story of Tesla. Edison does not have a significant role but their feud is mentioned.\n- **The Current War** (2017) - Biographical drama; directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Edison and Nicholas Hoult as Tesla. Depicts their intense rivalry and how both strive for dominance in the emerging electrical industry.\n- **Drunk History** (2013-2019) - TV show by Comedy Central. There is one episode of Season 1 which is called \"Tesla & Edison\". It humorously tells the story of Tesla, portrayed by John C. Reilly, and Edison, played by Crispin Glover.\n\nAlso various books and graphic novels illustrate the rivalry between Edison and Tesla. Instances are \"**Tesla: Man Out of Time**\" by Margaret Cheney, \"**The Last Days of Night**\" by Graham Moore, and \"**The Five Fists of Science**\" by Matt Fraction and Steven Sanders."

While Tesla did make important contributions to the development of early electromagnetic devices, such as the induction motor and AC power distribution system, the idea for the light bulb predated both Tesla's and Edison's contributions. In fact, the first known patent for an incandescent lamp was filed by English engineer Warren De la Rue in 1840, nearly 20 years before Edison and Tesla were born."
