      "content": "Gilbert's Syndrome is a common disorder of the liver that involves a decrease in the ability of the organ to process bilirubin, which is a yellow-orange substance produced by the normal breakdown of red blood cells. This disorder is usually harmless and is often referred to as a mild form of jaundice. Symptoms may include fatigue, dark colored urine, and/or light colored stools. Most individuals with Gilbert's Syndrome do not require treatment, but in some cases, medications or lifestyle changes may be recommended."
