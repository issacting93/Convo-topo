      "content": "Contrary to popular belief, plane's black boxes are not black. They are actually bright orange. The reason for this is that the bright orange color makes them easier to find after a crash. The orange color also makes the boxes more visible to search and rescue teams, even in difficult conditions, such as darkness or water.\r\n\r\nThe official name for a plane's black box is a flight recorder. There are two types of flight recorders: the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The FDR records information about the aircraft's performance, such as speed, altitude, and engine data. The CVR records conversations between the pilots and other sounds in the cockpit, such as radio transmissions and engine noises.\r\n\r\nFlight recorders are typically installed in the tail of the aircraft, where they are less likely to be damaged in a crash. They are also made of strong materials, such as titanium, to protect them from fire and impact.\r\n\r\nFlight recorders are essential for investigating aircraft accidents. The data they record can help investigators determine the cause of the accident and make recommendations to prevent future accidents."

      "content": "The term \"black box\" was first used to describe flight recorders in the early days of aviation. At that time, the recorders were actually black, and they were often damaged in accidents. This made them difficult to find and recover.\r\n\r\nIn the 1950s, flight recorders began to be made of more durable materials, and they were painted orange to make them easier to find. However, the term \"black box\" had already become well-established, and it is still used today, even though flight recorders are no longer black.\r\n\r\nHere are some other possible reasons why flight recorders are called \"black boxes\":\r\n\r\n* The inside of the recorders is black, because they contain a thin ray of light that is used to record data.\r\n* The recorders are often damaged in accidents, and they may appear blackened as a result.\r\n* The term \"black box\" is simply a way of referring to something that is mysterious or unknown. Flight recorders were once mysterious and unknown devices, but they are now essential tools for investigating aircraft accidents."
