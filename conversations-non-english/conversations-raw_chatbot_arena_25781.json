The ants will respond to the presence of beacons.\n \tRules\nThe game is played in turns. On each turn, both players perform any number of actions simultaneously.\nThe Map\nOn each run, the map is generated randomly and is made up of hexagonal cells.\n\nEach cell has an index and up to six neighbors. Each direction is labelled 0 to 5.\n\nHex directions\n\nEach cell has a type, which indicates what the cell contains:\n0 if it does not contain a resource.\n1 if it contains the egg resource.\n2 if it contains the crystal resource.\nThe amount of resources contained in each cell is also given, and is subject to change during the game as the ants harvest cells.\n\nA cell may also have a base on it. The players’ ants will start the game on these bases.\n\nBlue base\n\nEgg\nAnts & Beacons\nBoth players start with several ants placed on their bases. The players cannot move the ants directly but can place beacons to affect their movement.\n\nPlayers can place any number of beacons per turn but can only place one each per cell.\n\nWhen placing a beacon, players must give that beacon a strength. These beacon strengths act as weights, determining the proportion of ants that will be dispatched to each one.\n\nIn other words, the higher the beacon strength, the greater the percentage of your ants that will be sent to that beacon.\n\nExample\nIn the following example, there are three beacons of strength 2,1, and 2.\n\n\nWhite numbers in a colored diamond represent the ants. Here, 10 ants in total will be dispatched to the beacons.\n\nThe 10 ants will move to the three beacons, keeping the same proportions as the beacon strengths.\n\nThe ants will do their best to take the shortest paths to their designated beacons, moving at a speed of one cell per turn.\n\nIn between turns, the existing beacons are powered down and removed from play.\n\nUse beacons to place your ants in such a way to create harvesting chains between your bases and a resource.\n\nHarvesting Chains\nIn order to harvest crystal and score points, there must be an uninterrupted chain of cells containing your ants between the resource and your bases.\n\nThe amount of crystal harvested per turn is equal to the weakest link in the chain. In other words, it is the smallest amount of ants from the cells tha"

In other words, it is the smallest amount of ants from the cells that make up the chain.\n\n\nHere, the blue player will harvest 4 crystal per turn.\n\nIn games with multiple bases per player, the game will choose the best chain to either one of your bases.\n\nThe harvesting chains work the same way for the egg resource.\n\nHarvesting an egg cell will spawn as many ants as resources havested. The ants will spawn on the player’s base on the start of next turn. In games with multiple bases per player, the extra ants will spawn on each base, regardless of the base present in the harvest chain.\n\nHarvesting is calculated separately for each resource, and for each one the game will automatically choose the best chain from its cell to your base.\n\nAttack Chains\nA player’s harvest chains may be broken by their opponent’s attack chains.\n\nWhen computing harvest chains, some cells may have ants from both players. For each of these cells, the attack chain of both players is computed, and if one of the player has a lower value, this cell cannot be counted in the harvest chain.\n\nThe attack chain value for a given cell is the weakest link in a chain from that cell to one of the player’s bases.\nExample\n\nThe attack chains for the contested cell are: 5 for the red player and 3 for the blue player.\nThe harvest chain is unbroken.\n\nThe attack chains for the contested cell are: 5 for the red player and 8 for the blue player.\nThe harvest chain is broken.\nActions\nOn each turn players can do any amount of valid actions, which include:\n\nBEACON index strength: place a beacon of strength strength on cell index.\nLINE index1 index2 strength: place beacons all along a path from index1 to index2, all of strength strength. A shortest path is chosen automatically.\nWAIT: do nothing.\nMESSAGE text. Displays text on your side of the HUD.\nAction order for one turn\nLINE actions are computed.\nBEACON actions are computed.\nAnts move.\nEggs are harvested and new ants spawn.\nCrystal is harvested and points are scored.\n\nNote: when two players harvest from the same resource, they will both receive the full expected amount regardless of whether there is enough resource to support it.\nVictory Conditions\nYou have harvested at least half of the total crystal on the map before your opponent.\nYou have more cryst"

The amount of crystal harvested per turn is equal to the weakest link in the chain. The game works by placing beacons on the cells to create harvesting chains, and the player can choose which chain to use on each turn based on the strength of the beacon and the available cells. There are also attack chains that can break the chain between the ants and the resource. The action order for one turn is to place a beacon, place a line of beacons, move ants, harvest egg cells, and harvest crystal. The game ends when one player has harvested at least half of the total crystal on the map or more crystal than their opponent. The player who has more crystal wins the game."
