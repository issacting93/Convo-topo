In this election, the candidates are Rene Brosig, who is a conservative and has the support of the elderly, and Andreas Goebel, who is a center-left politician who has the support of young people.\n\nUnder Approval Voting, the voters would have made a subjective decision on who they believe is the best candidate based on their own preferences and beliefs. The candidate who best aligns with the voter's values and priorities would be elected."

It is possible that the numbers reflect the preferences of the voters, but it is also possible that they were influenced by other factors such as their ideology or the candidates' campaign promises."

It is possible that the number of votes received by each candidate was not enough to sway the election, or that the votes were not properly counted. The number of votes received is also not necessarily representative of how well each candidate was performing in the election."
