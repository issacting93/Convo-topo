They can make a move by taking a step forward, or they can stay where they are by taking no steps. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the game by having all of their points used up. When a player reaches the end of the game, they are promoted to a higher level.\n\nWhat are some of the rules of the game? Can you give me a brief description of how the game works?"
