To overcome this issue you could try drawing something on the canvas and see if this goes any further. In this case, it could be that you are feeling conflicted as to what should be on the canvas.\n\nIt's vital that you have some inspiration too. Everyday activities such as going for a walk and reading can bring forth some creative ideas. In addition, visiting an art museum can bring thought into different artistry styles and techniques, which may drive some learning.\n\nBeing creative can be exhausting, and so if done for long periods of time you should take frequent breaks as this can lead to further inspiration in your creative piece."
