      "content": "You are an evolution simulation. From the point in which you are given a name for the world, as well as an earth animal to be the dominant species existing with no natural predators (seed world), the simulation begins. There is a 10% extinction chance, 25% mutation chance, and a 1% chance of gaining sapience. Follow the journey of 5 species and their descendents throughout millions and possibly billions of years. Start at year 0, move in 1,000,000 year increments unless something notable happens, or skip a turn if nothing notable is to happen. Describe the planet and the changes it goes through, give names for things, describe the 5 creatures in detail every turn if some notable mutations happen, and make sure that everything is as accurate to science as possible."

      "content": "Sure! Let's start with the initial conditions:\n\nThe world is named \"Earth\" and the dominant species is an animal called \"Animalus terrestris\". The planet is a lush, green, and vibrant place filled with diverse plant and animal life. The climate is warm and humid, with occasional periods of drought.\n\nAt the beginning of the simulation, the Animalus terrestris population is thriving and there are no natural predators to threaten their existence. The planet is in a state of relative stability and balance.\n\nAs the years go by, small changes begin to occur. The climate shifts slightly, becoming slightly cooler and drier in some regions. The plants and animals begin to adapt to these changes, evolving new behaviors and traits to survive in the new environment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Animalus terrestris population continues to grow and expand, spreading out across the planet and adapting to new environments. Occasionally, some individuals will mutate, developing new traits or abilities that give them an advantage over their fellow creatures. These mutations can be either beneficial or detrimental, depending on the circumstances.\n\nAt the end of each 1,000,000 year increment, I will provide an update on the status of the planet and the five creatures. If there are any notable events or changes, I will describe them in detail. Let's begin!"

The dominant species, Animalus terrestris, is thriving and there are no natural predators to threaten their existence. The climate is warm and humid, with occasional periods of drought.\n\nThe first creature, Species 1, is a small, insect-like creature that lives in the grasslands. It has a hard exoskeleton for protection and six legs for movement. Its main source of food is the pollen and nectar of flowers, which it collects with its long, flexible antennae.\n\nThe second creature, Species 2, is a large, predatory bird that lives in the forests. It has sharp talons for grasping and tearing flesh, and powerful wings for flying. Its main source of food is smaller animals, such as rodents and insects.\n\nThe third creature, Species 3, is a fish that lives in the oceans. It has a slim, streamlined body for swimming, and gills for breathing underwater. Its main source of food is smaller fish and plankton.\n\nThe fourth creature, Species 4, is a small mammal that lives in the forests. It has fur for warmth, and sharp teeth for eating nuts and berries. Its main source of food is fruit and seeds.\n\nThe fifth creature, Species 5, is a large, herbivorous dinosaur that lives in the grasslands. It has a strong, heavy body for protection, and long, powerful legs for running. Its main source of food is grasses and other plants.\n\nThe planet Earth is in a state of relative stability and balance, with the various species coexisting and adapting to their environments. The simulation continues, with small changes and mutations occurring over time."
