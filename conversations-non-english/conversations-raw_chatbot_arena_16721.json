      "content": "The weather in San Francisco is very mild year-round. The average temperature is 57 degrees Fahrenheit, with highs in the 60s and lows in the 50s. The city gets about 60 inches of rain per year, which is spread out evenly throughout the year. San Francisco is known for its fog, which can be present on any day of the year. The fog is caused by the cold water of the Pacific Ocean meeting the warm air from the land. The fog can make it feel cooler than it actually is, so it's a good idea to bring a jacket if you're planning on spending time outdoors.\r\n\r\nI think the weather in San Francisco is very pleasant. It's not too hot or too cold, and the fog can be quite beautiful. I would love to visit San Francisco someday and experience the weather for myself."

They are the ones who we can count on to be honest with us, even when it's hard. And they are the ones who will always have our backs, no matter what.\r\n\r\nI am very lucky to have some very loyal friends in my life.
