One short, famous melody is \"Beethoven's Symphony No. 5\" which starts with the iconic notes:\n\nG - G - G - E♭ / F - F - F - D\n\nThis is the famous \"da-da-da-dum\" motif that has become synonymous with Beethoven's work. Keep in mind that these are the simplified, single-note versions of the melody, and the actual piece is more complex and orchestral."
