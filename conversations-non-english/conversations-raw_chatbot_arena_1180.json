A doughnut is shaped more like a human body because it has a central hole, which is similar to the opening at the top of a human body where the head is located. The surrounding ring of the doughnut is also similar to the shape of a human body, as it has a circular shape and is shaped like a belt around the body.</p><p>In contrast, a cube and a bowling ball do not have any holes, and their shapes are not as similar to the shape of a human body as a doughnut is. A cube is a rectangular solid object with sharp corners and edges, while a bowling ball is a sphere with a smooth surface.</p><p>I hope this helps to clarify the answer! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p></div></div>"
