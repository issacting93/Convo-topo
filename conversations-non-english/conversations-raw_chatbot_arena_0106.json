The recipe below will work perfectly.\nAsparagus and Sausage Pasta\n8 ounces dried pasta (spaghetti works well)\n8 ounces Italian sausage, removed from casings\n1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, trim the asparagus and cut into 1-inch pieces. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Add the asparagus and sauté, stirring occasionally, until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, stirring often, until the sausage is browned. Drain the pasta and return to the pot. Stir in the sausage mixture. Sprinkle with the parmesan and parsley and serve."
