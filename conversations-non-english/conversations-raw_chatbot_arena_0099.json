Please try to be sensitive to the fact that not everyone has a sense of humor like you do. \n\nHere are a few joke ideas:\n1. A cowboy and a golfer are sitting at a bar. The bartender asks, \"What's the difference between the two of you?\"\nThe cowboy says, \"I ride a horse, I'm an athlete; the golfer sits in a car, is quiet and is an accountant.\"\n\n2. What's the difference between a CEO and a waiter?\nA waiter can be replaced by another waiter; but a CEO cannot be replaced by another CEO."
