MIBs are used to provide information about the network, such as the behavior of network devices, the interfaces they use, and the services they provide. MIBs are used in networking protocols, such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), to provide information about the network that can be used to manage and configure the network. The MIB is defined using a set of functions, known as object identifiers (OIDs), which are used to access specific MIB information."
