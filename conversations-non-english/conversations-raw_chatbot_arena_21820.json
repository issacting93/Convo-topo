      "content": "In 2 Corinthians 12:9, the Apostle Paul writes: \"But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest on me.\"\n\nIn this passage, Paul is talking about his own personal struggles and weaknesses. He is saying that even though he is weak, God's grace is sufficient for him. God's grace is His unmerited favor, and it is available to all of us, regardless of our circumstances.\n\nPaul's words are a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles. God is with us, and His grace is sufficient for us. When we feel weak, we can rest in the knowledge that God's power is made perfect in our weakness.\n\nThis is a powerful and encouraging passage of Scripture. It reminds us that God is always with us, and that His grace is sufficient for us. No matter what we are going through, we can rest in the knowledge that God loves us and cares for us."

      "content": "Ms. Upton's class has been learning about waste management and how to reduce waste. Recently, they made muesli slices! This recipe can be kept fresh in an airtight container rather than in a disposable package, and it's healthy too! Here are some photos to view:\n\n[Image of a group of students in a kitchen, making muesli slices.]\n\n[Image of a close-up of the muesli slices, showing the ingredients.]\n\n[Image of a student enjoying a muesli slice.]\n\nMuesli slices are a great way to reduce waste because they can be stored in an airtight container and eaten over time.
