This can be done by organizing the documentation into sections that are related to different topics, using headings and subheadings to break up the content and make it easier to navigate. Additionally, it is important to provide clear and concise information in the documentation, using bullet points and clear language to explain complex concepts. Finally, it is important to provide documentation that is up-to-date and relevant, by regularly reviewing and updating the structure and content of the documentation."
