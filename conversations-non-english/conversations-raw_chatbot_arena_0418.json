      "content": "Here is the problem with the answer \"yes\":\nAlice and Bob are lost in a desert and Alice is injured and cannot walk. If Bob carries Alice, they both have a 33% chance of survival, but if Bob leaves Alice his chance increases by 9%.\nLet's assume that the probability of Alice surviving is the same as the probability of Bob surviving:\n33% of surviving is equal to the probability of Alice surviving.\nIf Bob carries Alice, the probability of Alice surviving increases by 9%, as she is no longer in a position to help Bob walk or to get assistance. The probability of Alice surviving is then 9% greater than the probability of Bob surviving.\nTherefore, if Bob carries Alice, they both have a 33% chance of survival.\nIf Bob leaves Alice, his chance of surviving increases by 9%, which means that his chance of surviving increases by 9%. The probability of Alice surviving is still 9% greater than the probability of Bob surviving."
