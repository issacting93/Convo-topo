      "content": "It is not possible to implement an LRU cache in Swift. LRU stands for \"Least recently used\" and is a makeshift solution to the problem of memory management in computer programs. In an LRU cache, the most recently used items are removed from the cache first in order to make room for new items.\n\nIn Swift, memory management is implemented using reference counting, which tracks the number of references to each object in memory. This allows the Swift runtime to determine when an object is no longer needed and free up its memory. It is not possible to implement an LRU cache using reference counting, as removing an object from the cache would require changing the reference count of other objects in memory, which could result in unpredictable behavior.\n\nIt is recommended to use a standard memory management library, such as Foundation or Collection, instead of implementing your own LRU cache in Swift. These libraries provide built-in functionality for managing memory, such as removing items from a cache based on their age or usage frequency, and can be easily integrated into your Swift code."

      "content": "Here is an implementation of an LRU cache in Python:\n\n```python\nclassLRUCache:\n    def __init__(self, capacity=10):\n        self.cache = []\n        self.size = 0\n        self.capacity = capacity\n    def put(self, key, value):\n        if not self.size:\n            self.cache.append(key)\n            self.size = 1\n        else:\n            self.cache.remove(self.size)\n            self.size -= 1\n            self.cache.append(key)\n\n    def get(self, key):\n        if self.size == 0:\n            return None\n        else:\n            return self.cache[self.size - 1][key]\n```\n\nThis implementation of the LRU cache uses a list to store the cache items, with a capacity of 10 items. The put() method adds an item to the cache if the cache is empty, or removes an item from the cache if it is full. The get() method returns the item with the largest key value that is still in the cache, or None if the cache is empty.\n\nIt's worth noting that the LRU cache in this implementation does not support removing items from the cache based on their age or usage frequency, as these factors are not taken into consideration when choosing the item with the largest key value. However, this implementation provides a basic implementation of an LRU cache that can be easily modified to support these additional features."
