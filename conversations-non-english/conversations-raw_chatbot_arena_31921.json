      "content": "Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that is used for managing and deploying containerized applications at scale. It is ideal for use cases where you need to manage a large number of containers and want to take advantage of features such as container replication, scaling, and scheduling. Kubernetes is also useful for managing stateful applications that have a persistent storage requirement, as it provides built-in support for managing storage and networking.\n\nLambda/Step functions are serverless functions that can be triggered by events and execute without the need for a server or an operating system. They are ideal for use cases where you need to respond to events quickly and want to avoid the overhead of managing servers. Lambda/Step functions are also useful for building event-driven microservices that can be deployed and scaled independently of each other.\n\nIn summary, if you need to manage a large number of containers and want to take advantage of advanced features such as container replication, scaling, and scheduling, then Kubernetes is the better choice. If you need to respond to events quickly and prefer to avoid the overhead of managing servers, then Lambda/Step functions are the better choice."
