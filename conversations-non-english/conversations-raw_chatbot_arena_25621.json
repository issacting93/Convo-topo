Here's an easy LeetCode-style question for you:\n\nWrite a function that takes in a list of integers and returns the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three numbers in the list. For example, if the input list is [3, 4, 5], the function should return the product of 3, 4, and 5, which is 30. If the input list is [2, 2, 2], the function should return 24, since the largest product that can be made is 2 \\* 2 \\* 2."
