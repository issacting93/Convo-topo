      "content": "Executive Dysfunction is a condition that affects a person's ability to make decisions, while Autistic Inertia is a condition that affects a person's willingness to act. For example, a person with Executive Dysfunction may ask a thousand questions before making a decision, but once a decision is made, the person is unable to fully grasp the implications of that decision. On the other hand, a person with Autistic Inertia may ask the same thousand questions, but the questions simply exhaust the person and cause them to give up on making a decision."
