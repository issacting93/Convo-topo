This is to prevent them from carrying the smell indoors.\n\nSTEP 2: Mix the following in a bucket.\n- 1 quart of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (available at any pharmacy)\n- 1/4 cup baking soda\n- 1-2 teaspoons of liquid dishwashing soap\n\nSTEP 3: Wearing rubber gloves, work the foaming mixture into your dog's coat thoroughly, then allow to sit for 5 minutes.\n\nSTEP 4: Rinse your dog with warm water. \n\nSTEP 5: Wash your dog with a normal pet shampoo, rinse thoroughly, and dry them with a towel.\n\nWARNINGS: \n- Be careful around your dog\u2019s eyes. The de-skunking mixture is potent and may cause eye irritation.\n- Don\u2019t use a higher than 3% hydrogen peroxide solution as it may burn. \n- The hydrogen peroxide may bleach the dog's coat. The less time the solution stays on the less likely it is to cause bleaching.\n- It takes some time for skunk oil to fully saturate into the hair, so this solution will be most effective if applied quickly."

      "content": "First, put on rubber gloves and other protective gear. Then, using a hose or bucket of warm water, thoroughly rinse your dog to remove as much of the skunk oil as possible. Be sure to avoid getting the water in your dog's eyes, nose or ears. You may also want to use a pet-safe skunk-odor removing product to help neutralize any remaining odor. Finally, give your dog a thorough bath with a pet-safe shampoo. If the smell persists, contact your veterinarian for further advice."

In such cases, it may be necessary to repeat the bathing process several times. Additionally, it's important to keep your pet away from skunks in the future, as getting sprayed again will only make the problem worse."
