Regular maintenance of the cleaning tasks will help to avoid a buildup of dirt and grime."

Arrange a private conversation with your roommate and calmly express your concerns.\n2.  Listen to their side of the story and try to understand their viewpoint.\n3.  Work together to find a solution, such as dividing responsibilities more equally or creating a schedule to ensure completion.\n4.  If no agreement can be reached, consider seeking the assistance of a neutral party, like a mediator or resident advisor.\n5.  If necessary, you may need to consider finding a new roommate.\n\nIt is beneficial for all involved parties to handle the situation respectfully and to approach it with an open mind, as good communication is essential in resolving roommate conflicts. I wish you and your roommate good luck!"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Instead of doing all the cleanup yourself and your roommate living in a clean apartment without doing any of the work, you should re-discuss the agreed schedule. This could be as simple as changing the weekly tasks to by-weekly and the monthly tasks to by-monthly. You will be living in a slightly less clean apartment but your roommate will be too, which hopefully puts a limit on how far the roommate will scale down the cleaning. As a bonus you get to do less cleaning too."

      "content": "A common tactic in this type of situation is to ignore your part of the duties as well while making it clear that this behaviour, unlike his, is not out of neglect but is a deliberate protest. Your roomate will hate the mess that builds up just as much as you will, and eventually will come to the negotiation table with you."

Keeping a shared task list and schedule can help ensure a fair and consistent cleaning routine."

Working together is very efficient, and could also be fun."
