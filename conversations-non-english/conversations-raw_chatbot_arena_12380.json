If Anne is married, then a married person (Anne) is looking at an unmarried person (George).\n2. If Anne is not married, then a married person (Jack) is looking at an unmarried person (Anne).\n\nIn both scenarios, a married person is looking at an unmarried person."

      "content": "No, he should not spin the chambers again. If he doesn't spin the chambers again, the probability of the next chamber containing the bullet is 1 in 5, since there are now only 5 chambers left and 1 of them has the bullet.\n\nIf he spins the chambers again, the odds go back to the original probability of 1 in 6, which is worse for you. So it would be better for you if he does not spin the chambers again before firing the second time."

      "content": "Since Susan won 3 bets and Lisa won $5, this means that Lisa won 5 more games than Susan. Let's represent the number of games Lisa won as L and the number of games Susan won as S. We are given:\n\nS = 3\nL = S + 5\n\nNow we can substitute the value of S into the second equation:\n\nL = 3 + 5\nL = 8\n\nSo, Lisa won 8 games. In total, they played 8 (Lisa's wins) + 3 (Susan's wins) = 11 games."
