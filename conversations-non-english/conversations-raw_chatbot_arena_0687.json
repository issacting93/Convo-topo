Tell me the correct answer, explain it is correct, and why each of the other answers are wrong in simple words as if explaining to a high school student.\n\nThe stimulus:\nMagazine editor: I know that some of our regular advertisers have been pressuring us to give favorable mention to their products in our articles, but they should realize that for us to yield to their wishes would actually be against their interests. To remain an effective advertising vehicle we must have loyal readership, and we would soon lose that readership if our readers suspect that our editorial integrity has been compromised by pandering to advertisers.\n\nAdvertising-sales director: You underestimate the sophistication of our readers. They recognize that the advertisements we carry are not articles, so their response to the advertisements has never depended on their opinion of the editorial integrity of the magazine as a whole.\n\nThe question:\nWhich one of the following is the most accurate assessment of the advertising-sales director’s argument as a response to the magazine editor’s argument?\n\nThe answer options:\nA. It succeeds because it shows that the editor’s argument depends on an unwarranted assumption about factors affecting an advertisement’s effectiveness.\nB. It succeeds because it exposes as mistaken the editor’s estimation of the sophistication of the magazine’s readers.\nC.

It succeeds because it exposes as mistaken the editor’s estimation of the sophistication of the magazine’s readers.\nThe reason:\nThe advertising-sales director’s argument shows that the editor’s assumption about the impact of editorial integrity on advertising response is incorrect: the magazine’s readership is sophisticated enough to not be influenced by editorial integrity. Therefore, the advertising-sales director’s argument succeeds."

Tell me the correct answer, explain why it is correct and why each of the other answers are wrong in simple words.\n\nStimulus:\nMary, a veterinary student, has been assigned an experiment in mammalian physiology that would require her to take a healthy, anesthetized dog and subject it to a drastic blood loss in order to observe the physiological consequences of shock. The dog would neither regain consciousness nor survive the experiment. Mary decides not to do this assignment.\n\nQuestion:\nMary’s decision most closely accords with which one of the following principles?\n\nAnswers:\nA. All other things being equal, gratuitously causing any animal to suffer pain is unjustified.\nB. Taking the life of an animal is not justifiable unless doing so would immediately assist in saving several animal lives or in protecting the health of a person.\nC. The only sufficient justification for experimenting on animals is that future animal suffering is thereby prevented.\nD. Practicing veterinarians have a professional obligation to strive to prevent the unnecessary death of an animal except in cases of severely ill or injured animals whose prospects for recovery are dim.\nE. No one is ever justified in acting with the sole intention of causing the death of a living thing, be it animal or human."
