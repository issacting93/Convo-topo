      "content": "Relativity is the idea that the laws of physics, including the laws of motion, are the same for all observers in uniform relative motion. This means that the laws of physics do not change in different reference frames. For example, the laws of physics that describe how objects move are the same for two people moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other."

      "content": "Relativity is like playing a game of chess, where the same rules apply to everyone, no matter where they are on the board. It means that the same rules apply to the pieces, to the players, and to the game itself, no matter how far apart the pieces are or how fast they are moving. The rules of chess don't change if one player is on the board and the other is not, or if one player is moving fast and the other is not. The rules are the same for both players, and that's what makes chess a fair game."

From your perspective, your friend is playing the game and you are not. But from your friend's perspective, it looks like you are playing the game and your friend is not. According to the rules of chess, both of you are playing the game and the rules are the same for both of you, no matter where you are on the board or how fast you are moving. This is what we mean by relativity."
