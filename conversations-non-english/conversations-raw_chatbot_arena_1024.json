      "content": "It is generally not a good idea to store any user information, includingjwts, in a shared database like Redis. Redis is a high-level内存 database that can be used to store a variety of data, but it is not particularly designed for security. If a jwt is stored in Redis, it can be accessed and used by any application that is listening on the same port. This can cause security issues if the jwt is not properly secured.\n\nTo store a jwt in Redis, you should use a secure storage mechanism like a JWT server, such as WebStart or OpenJWT. This will ensure that the jwt is only accessible to the application that created it and will prevent it from being accessed by other applications on the same machine.\n\nIt is also important to note that if you are not handling the authentication for the jwt, you should not store the jwt or any other sensitive information in the database. You should only store the认证 data, such as the user's name or email, in the application code or a separate authentication server."

      "content": "If you are need to use the user's jwt to access some information on another site, there are several options you can consider to store the token in.\n\nOne option is to use a JWT server like WebStart or OpenJWT to store the JWT on the server side. This will ensure that the JWT is only accessible to the application that created it and will prevent it from being accessed by other applications on the same machine.\n\nAnother option is to use a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store the JWT. These databases are designed for storing large amounts of data and can be more secure than a shared database like Redis. However, they may be more complex to use and may require more setup work.\n\nIn any case, it is important to store the JWT with sufficient permissions to access the information that it is meant to access. This can be done by storing the JWT in a way that requires the user to provide a username and password to access the information, or by providing a unique token for each user that can be used to access their information.\n\nIn summary, the choice of where to store a JWT depends on your specific requirements and the security requirements of your application. It may be more secure to store the JWT on the server side with a JWT server or in a database that is designed for storing data, but it may also require more setup work and may not be as performant as other options. Ultimately, you should carefully consider your security requirements and choose a solution that is appropriate for your use case."
