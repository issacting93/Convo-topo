The union of two languages L1 and L2 is a set of strings that can be written as a combination of strings from L1 and L2. The union of L3 and L4 is also a set of strings that can be written as a combination of strings from L3 and L4. However, the relationship between L1L2 and L3L4 depends on the relationship between the individual languages L1, L2, L3, and L4. If L1L2 is a subset of L3L4, meaning that every string in L1L2 is also in L3L4, then L1L2 would be a subset of L3L4. However, this is not necessarily true just because L1 union L2 is a subset of L3 union L4."
