      "content": "The very last scene of the film Interstellar is a震撼人心 one. In this scene, the main character, Dr. Brand, is shown on a remote planet in the外层空间， where the universe has expanded to a point where nothing but孤独 and emptiness exist. Dr. Brand is seen sitting on a small chair, surrounded by a group of people who are also in a small room. They all look different from each other, with different physical forms and faces. \n\nAs the scene fades, one of the people in the group, played by Chinese actor Liu Xiao碱性， speaks up. He says, \\\"We are all alone in this universe, but together, we can create a new one. Dr. Brand, you and I have been together for so long, but we will never be alone. Our love will always be with us, in this new world that we have created.\\\" \n\nThe scene ends with Dr. Brand and Liu Xiao碱性 turned to each other, holding hands and smiling. The camera pans out to show the vastness of the宇宙， and the end of the film. It is a beautiful and heartwarming scene, and one of the most powerful and memorable in the entire film."
