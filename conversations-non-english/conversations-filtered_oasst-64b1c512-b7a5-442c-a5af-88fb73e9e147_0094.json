Tolkien, decided to not include in the Lord of the Rings about how Frodo used the invisibility powers of the Ring to torment and scare local villagers.  Enjoy!\n\nIn the Shire, beneath the moon so bright,\nWhere Hobbits dwell, and lanterns light,\nThere lived a Hobbit, Frodo named,\nWhose tricks and jests brought him some fame.\n\nUpon his finger, slipped a Ring,\nAn artifact of shadowed king,\nIts power great, invisibility,\nA secret Frodo kept, quite sneakily.\n\nOne day, he thought, with twinkling eyes,\nTo give the villagers a surprise,\nHe wore the Ring and vanished clear,\nAnd crept among them, grinning ear to ear.\n\nIn the Green Dragon, the ale did flow,\nAnd Hobbits drank, their cheeks aglow,\nWhen Frodo, unseen, a trick did play,\nHe pinched their bottoms, and slipped away.\n\nThey yelped and jumped, with faces red,\nAs others laughed, and teasing said,\n\"Who plays such tricks, to our dismay?\"\nBut Frodo hid, and would not say.\n\nHe tiptoed soft, through fields and lanes,\nAmong the gardens, rich with grains,\nWhere laundry hung, like banners bright,\nHe tied the knots and took his flight.\n\nNext morning came, with sun's first light,\nThe Hobbits found their clothes wound tight,\n\"Who could have done this?\" they exclaimed,\nAs Frodo chuckled, unrestrained.\n\nAt market square, the stalls were set,\nWith goods and trinkets, Hobbits met,\nThen Frodo, Ring-clad, passed unseen,\nAnd moved the wares, with hands so keen.\n\nThe apples rolled, the carrots flew,\nAs chaos grew, confusion too,\nThe Hobbits scratched their puzzled heads,\nAs laughter filled young Frodo's chest.\n\nWhen all his tricks and games were done,\nHe stole away, and swiftly run,\nRemoved the Ring, with sigh and smile,\nRejoined his friends, quite free of guile.\n\nIn secret, Frodo's heart was light,\nAs tales of jests spread through the night,\nHe knew the Ring held darker fate,\nBut for a while, he'd dance with fate.\n\nAnd so, in Shire's green and gold,\nA tale of Frodo's tricks was told,\nOf how the Ring, for just one day,\nBrought laughter, where the shadows lay."

To the mines we go,\nWith our picks and shovels, row by row,\nDelving deep for gems aglow,\nIn the heart of the mountain, treasures sow!\n\n(Verse 2)\nWith beards of grey and braids of gold,\nOur tales of valor and might retold,\nWe carve our kingdoms in the rock,\nAs sturdy as our dwarven stock!\n\n(Chorus)\nHo! Ho! To the mines we go,\nWith our picks and shovels, row by row,\nDelving deep for gems aglow,\nIn the heart of the mountain, treasures sow!\n\n(Bridge)\nIn the dark, we stand as one,\nBeneath the earth, bereft of sun,\nTogether we face the shadows tall,\nOur axes ready, we heed the call!\n\n(Verse 3)\nWe drink our ale and laugh with glee,\nAt stories shared of victory,\nThe dragon's hoard, the gold we've won,\nOur legacy has just begun!\n\n(Chorus)\nHo! Ho! To the mines we go,\nWith our picks and shovels, row by row,\nDelving deep for gems aglow,\nIn the heart of the mountain, treasures sow!\n\n(Outro)\nSo raise your voice and join the throng,\nIn the ancient dwarven song,\nOur heritage, our pride, our might,\nIn the caverns deep, we'll forge our light!"
