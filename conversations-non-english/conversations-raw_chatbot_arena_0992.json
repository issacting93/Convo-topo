      "content": "To extract the rest of the string after the CIF using a regular expression, we can use a positive lookahead assertion to match one or more characters that are not a letter or a digit, followed by the letter \"B\", and the letter \"d\". This pattern matches the rest of the string after the CIF. Here's the Python code to extract the rest of the string using a positive lookahead assertion:\n```python\nimport re\nsdafsdfasB12345678CRonda = \"sdafsdfasB12345678CRonda\"\ncif = re.search(r\"(?!\\d+\\D)\", sdafsdfasB12345678CRonda).group()\nprint(cif)\n```\nThis code uses the `re.search()` function to search for the pattern `^(?!\\d+\\D)`. The `^(?!\\d+\\D)` pattern matches the beginning of the string (^), one or more characters that are not a letter or a digit, followed by the letter \"B\", and the letter \"d\" until the end of the string. The `\\D` is a negative character class that matches any character that is not a digit.\nThe `^` anchor at the beginning of the pattern ensures that the match starts at the beginning of the string. The `\\d+\\D` pattern matches one or more digits (\\d) followed by any character that is not a digit (\\D). The `\\d+\\D` pattern is repeated one or more times.\nThe `re.search()` function returns a `MatchObject` object if a match is found, and `None` if no match is found. The `.group()` method returns the matched string, which in this case is the CIF."
