      "content": "AirTags are designed by Apple to work primarily with Apple devices, specifically those running iOS 14.5 or later. As of now, there is no official support for Android phones. However, Android users can still use the NFC feature on their phones to scan an AirTag and access the \"Lost Mode\" information if the owner has enabled it. But, Android users won't be able to set up or fully utilize the AirTag features like an iPhone user can."
