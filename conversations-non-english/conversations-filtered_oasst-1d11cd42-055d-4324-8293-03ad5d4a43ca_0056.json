      "content": "Slap Shot is a 1977 American sports comedy film directed by George Roy Hill, written by Nancy Dowd and starring Paul Newman and Michael Ontkean. It depicts a minor league ice hockey team that resorts to violent play to gain popularity in a declining factory town.\n\nDowd based much of her script, as well as several of the characters, on her brother Ned Dowd's playing experiences on 1970s minor league professional hockey teams.\n\nWhile Slap Shot received mixed reviews upon release and was only a moderate box office success, it has since become widely regarded as a cult film.\n\nPlot\nIn the fictional small town of Charlestown, Pennsylvania, the local steel mill is about to close permanently and lay off 10,000 workers, indirectly threatening the existence of the town's minor league hockey team, the Charlestown Chiefs, who are also struggling with a losing season and an increasingly hostile crowd. After discovering the hometown fans responding positively to an on-ice brawl with the opposing goalie, player-coach Reggie Dunlop goads his own team into a violent style of play, eventually letting the overly-aggressive Hanson Brothers, the club's recent acquisitions, loose on their opponents. The brothers' actively violent and thuggish style of play excites the fans, which increases revenue, potentially saving the team.\n\nThe team's new style produces unintended consequences that affect not only Dunlop, but the Chiefs' star player, Ned Braden, along with the rest of the team. Braden refuses to take part in the violent antics, as Dunlop attempts to exploit Braden's marital troubles in his efforts to get him to take part in the team's brawling, but to no avail. Several games degenerate into bench-clearing brawls, including one that takes place before the opening face-off, and another that brings the local police into the locker room to arrest the Hanson Brothers after they attack the opposing fans in the stands. Nonetheless, the Chiefs rise up the ranks to become contenders for the championship, and a rumor (started by Dunlop himself to further motivate his teammates) spreads that the team's success could possibly lead them to be sold to a buyer in Florida.\n\nEventually Dunlop meets team owner Anita McCambridge, and discovers his efforts to increase the team's popularity (and value) through violence have been for naught, as McCambridge's better option is to fold the team as a tax write-off. By the time Dunlop decides to abandon the new strategy of violence over skill, the Chiefs' main rivals in Syracuse have already upped the ante by stocking their team full of violent \"goons\" (many of whom were previously suspended from the league for flagrant violations) in preparation for the league's championship game. After being crushed during the first period while playing a non-violent style of \"old time hockey,\" the disgusted general manager tells them that various National Hockey League scouts accepted his invitation to the game, as he was hoping that the Chiefs' habitual escapades would get the players signed to the major leagues.\n\nUpon hearing this news, Dunlop decides to have his team revert to their previous violent approach, much to the joy of the spectators. When Braden witnesses his now-estranged wife cheering for the Chiefs, he realizes the absurdity of the violence, and adopts a similarly radical (but still non-violent) way of participation by performing a live striptease on the rink amid rousing cheers. When the Syracuse team's captain protests against this \"obscene\" demonstration and hits the referee for dismissing him, Syracuse is disqualified, granting the Chiefs the championship. After their win, and with the Chiefs now effectively folded and finished, Dunlop accepts the offer to be the player-coach to the Minnesota Nighthawks, bringing his teammates with him."

      "content": "The VEX IQ Competition Slapshot is played on a 6’ x 8’ rectangular field with a Fence parallel to the shorter edge, 5 Dispensers loaded with 45 Discs on one side,  and 4 Goal Zones on the other. Robots will begin the match on the Dispensers side, contacting the field perimeter wall furthest from the Fence. They will be interacting with the Dispensers to remove the Discs inside, and each removed Disc worths 1 point. More points can be scored by launching the Discs under the Fence into the Goal Zones on the other side, but robots are not allowed to crossing the fence while scoring Discs. At the end of the match, robors can reach over the Fence for the contact zones to get an additional 1 point per Disc that is scored in the corresponding Goal Zone. \nFirst, 2 teams will collaborate in 60 second long teamwork matches to score as much point as possible, and the two teams will recieve the same score. Each team consists of two drivers and one robot, and each driver will be operating for half of the match. Next, each team will compete in the Robot Skills Challenge. These matches consist of Driving Skills Matches, which will be 60 seconds long and entirely driver controlled, and Programming Skills Matches with no drivers and 60 seconds of autonomous operation to score points."

The VEX system consists of hardware, software, and a variety of accessories and parts that allow users to design and build a wide range of robots.\n\nVEX offers different levels of difficulty, from beginner to advanced, to accommodate a wide range of skill levels and age groups. The VEX IQ platform is geared towards elementary and middle school students, while the VEX EDR platform is designed for high school and college students.\n\nThe VEX programming software, called VEXcode, is designed to be user-friendly and offers both block-based and text-based programming options. VEX robots are controlled by a microcontroller, which communicates with various sensors and motors to execute the programmed tasks.\n\nVEX also offers various competitions and challenges, where teams of students compete against each other using their custom-built robots. These competitions can be local or regional, and some teams even compete at national and international levels."

A VSCode extension can be found in the marketplace to assist students with coding.\n\nBlocks works on Chromebooks, Amazon Fire, Android tablets, iPads, Windows and Mac. It provides a drag and drop interface that allow the user to create sequences of command logic for the robots. Each command is a block which may have a configurable input the defines the behavior of the robot. Every block is color coordinated and grouped with similar types of commands. Once a sequence of commands is finalized the blocks platform can run the code. This process involves compiling and downloading the code to the robot and executing the given command sequence. \n\nWhen using Python or C++, then the VEXapi must be imported or included respective to the language being used. The API is then used to define command sequences and logic for the robot to use."

      "content": "According to https://www.vexrobotics.com/iq/competition/viqc-current-game, Slapshot is a VEX IQ Competition game that involves two robots working as an alliance to score points by launching balls into goals. There are three types of balls: green (1 point), orange (2 points), and purple (5 points). There are also three types of goals: low (1x multiplier), mid (2x multiplier), and high (3x multiplier). The robots can use a launcher device to shoot the balls into the goals.\n\nThe robots can score points by:\n\n* Scoring Balls into Goals – Robots score points by launching Balls into Goals. The point value for each Ball is multiplied by the Goal’s multiplier. For example, a green Ball scored in a mid Goal is worth 2 points (1 x 2).\n* Completing Rows – Robots score bonus points by completing a Row of three Goals that have at least one Ball of their Alliance’s color. A completed Row is worth 6 bonus points for each Ball in that Row that matches the Alliance’s color. For example, if an Alliance completes a Row with two orange Balls and one purple Ball, they score 18 bonus points (6 x 3).\n* Completing Columns – Robots score bonus points by completing a Column of three Goals that have at least one Ball of their Alliance’s color. A completed Column is worth 9 bonus points for each Ball in that Column that matches the Alliance’s color. For example, if an Alliance completes a Column with two green Balls and one purple Ball, they score 27 bonus points (9 x 3).\n\nI hope this helps you understand how the robots score points in the Slapshot game."
