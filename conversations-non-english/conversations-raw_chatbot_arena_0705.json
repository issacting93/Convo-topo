      "content": "long long ago, in a time and a place that no man can know, the laws of physics came into existence and the universe was born.  In that infinite universe was infinite possibility and the seeds of our current existence were planted in the great void.  Over time, the seeds took root and grew into the first galaxies.  Those first galaxies grew over time into the first clusters of galaxies.  And in time, those first galaxies grew into the first lifeforms.  These first lifeforms were simple single-celled organisms that floated in the ocean of space.  They ate, they excreted, and over time, the universe came to be populated with billions of these simple multi-celled organisms.  And as the simple organisms evolved into more complex organisms, the gods of these primitive organisms looked upon the universe and saw that it was good.  Over the eons, the gods of these simple organisms created many different forms of life, all of which were also simple and single-celled.  The gods of these organisms populated the universe with billions of worlds and billions of forms of life, and the process repeated itself over and over again.  millions of years passed and evolution continued and life evolved.  As the universe aged, so did life.  Over time, simple single-celled organisms evolved into more complex multi-celled organisms.  And as life evolved, so did their gods.  These gods, now complex enough to understand the process of evolution, saw that life was good.  They saw that over time, life evolved from a simple form, to a more complex form, to an even more complex form.  They saw that life, as they defined life, was good.  They saw that diversity was important for the health of the ecosystem and for the continued existence of life on worlds like theirs.  They saw that they were part of something greater than themselves.  They saw that they were an integral part of the universe, and they saw that this was good.  millions of years passed and evolution continued and life evolved.  As the universe aged, so did life.  Over time, simple multi-celled organisms evolved into more complex organisms.  And as organisms evolved, so did their gods.  These gods, now complex enough to understand the process of evolution, saw that life was good.
