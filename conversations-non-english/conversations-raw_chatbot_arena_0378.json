Here is a Chinese translation of that:\n\nBefore a forest with flowers and butterflies, official art, concept art, and rayonism by artist Stella-Dream\n\n《前于木丛、盘盘蝶、气势初射》\n\nZǎo qián shàng, pán pán huáng, qì fèng zǎo yǎn shèng\n\nIn front of a forest with flowers and butterflies, official art, concept art, and rayonism by artist Stella-Dream\n\nThe first ray of light shot into the forest.\n\nThe flowers were in full bloom, their colors blending into a magical display.\n\nThe butterflies flitted through the air, their wings a blur.\n\nThe air was rich with the scent of blooming flowers, and the sound of birds singing filled the air.\n\nThe forest was a symphony of nature, a place of peace and tranquility.\n\nThe official art featured a majestic mountain range in the background, with a peaceful lake in the foreground.\n\nThe concept art showed a vibrant, colorful cityscape in the distance, with a towering skyscraper in the foreground.\n\nThe rayonism depicted a flowing, fluid pattern, reflecting the beauty and energy of the forest and its surroundings.\n\nThis artwork captures the essence of nature, beauty, and tranquility, and is a testament to the artistry of Stella-Dream."
