      "content": "The main effect of either approach will be that the scallops will take on the flavor of the curry. The stew approach will give the curry a more intense flavor, while the searing approach will result in a mild flavor.\n\nPersonally, I would choose the searing approach as it will result in a mild flavor and still give the scallops a nice crust. There are many different flavors of curry, so you can adjust the spices and seasonings to your own taste."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "No, the risk of iodine flavour in the stewing approach is minimal. Iodine is one of the essential minerals found in many types of seafood, and is naturally present in the ocean. However, when cooked in a stew, it is usually bound to proteins or other substances, and is not likely to be tasted by humans.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the taste of the stew, you may want to try a lower dosage of the curry or add some other spices to mask the taste of the iodine."
