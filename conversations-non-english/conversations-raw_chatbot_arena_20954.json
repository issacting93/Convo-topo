      "content": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever. While ibuprofen is generally considered safe for most people, including pregnant women, there are some potential risks and precautions that should be considered.\n\nIn general, the use of ibuprofen during pregnancy is considered safe when used at recommended doses for short periods of time, and under the guidance of a healthcare provider. However, there is some evidence that long-term use of ibuprofen during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of complications such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and bleeding in the mother and baby.\n\nIf you are pregnant and considering using ibuprofen, it is important to talk to your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of the medication, and to follow their recommendations for use. Your healthcare provider may also be able to suggest alternative treatments for your symptoms.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that all medications carry some risks, and that the decision to use any medication during pregnancy should be made in consultation with your healthcare provider."
