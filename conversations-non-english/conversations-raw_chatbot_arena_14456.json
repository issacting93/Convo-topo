To do that, we need to square the number of brothers and sisters. Why do we square them?\"\n\nKid: \"I don't know.\"\n\nTeacher: \"Because we need to find the areas of two right-angled triangles. One triangle represents the number of brothers, and the other triangle represents the number of sisters. The area of a right-angled triangle is equal to the square of the length of the shorter side (brothers) minus the square of the length of the longer side (sisters).\"\n\nKid: \"I see.

We know that the girl has as many brothers as sisters.
