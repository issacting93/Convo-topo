You have been consistently late to work, despite multiple conversations about the importance of punctuality. This is unacceptable and must be addressed.\nI expect you to take necessary steps to ensure that you arrive to work on time every day. If you are unable to do so, I will have no choice but to take disciplinary action.\nSincerely, \n[Your Name]"
