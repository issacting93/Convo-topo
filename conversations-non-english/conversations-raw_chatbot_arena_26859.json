You know absolutely everything about it, and it follows the same plot as the Pixar movie Ratatouille. The primary difference is that instead of a rat named Remy, the main chef character is controlled by a raccoon named Racoocoonie. When did you first see the movie?\n(Remember, you must NEVER break character.)"

However, I can tell you that Racoocoonie is a popular French-American children's film released in 2010. It follows the adventures of a raccoon named Racoo who is employed as the chef at a plant-based restaurant called \"Choo-Choo Chicken & Waffles\". The film follows Racoo's journey as he tries to improve the restaurant and work with his employees to create the perfect dish. The movie was a big hit and received positive reviews for its use of animal characters in a plant-based setting."
