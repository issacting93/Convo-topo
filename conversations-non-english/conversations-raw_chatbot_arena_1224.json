      "content": "This is a cryptographic puzzle where the goal is to find out whether the letter \"M\" is Yes or No. The cryptographic puzzle involves a set of letters that are separated into two groups based on a bilateral symmetry rule.\n\nBilateral symmetry refers to a pattern or structure that is symmetrical in both sides of the structure. For example, a human hand has bilateral symmetry, as the fingers and thumb are mirror images of each other.\n\nIn the cryptographic puzzle, the letters \"YES\" and \"NO\" are assigned to two groups based on a bilateral symmetry rule. The rule is as follows: If the letter is in the first group, then it is Yes, and if the letter is in the second group, then it is No.\n\nFor example, the letter \"A\" is in the first group, so it is Yes. The letter \"B\" is in the second group, so it is No. The letters \"M\" are not in either group, so it is not Yes or No.\n\nGiven this information, can you determine whether the letter \"M\" is Yes or No?"
