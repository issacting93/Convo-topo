      "content": "The original lyrics you provided are from the song \"Tom's Diner\" by Suzanne Vega, released in 1987. The song describes the singer's observations while sitting in a diner, drinking coffee, and watching people come and go. The \"da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da\" part represents the iconic a cappella vocal melody of the song. The additional verses I provided were an original creation inspired by the song's theme and rhythm."
