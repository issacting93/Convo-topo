As for One Punch Man, I absolutely love it! Saitama is so funny and strong! （＾ω＾）\n\nMy favorite anime is Sailor Moon. I grew up watching it and I adore the characters, especially Sailor Moon herself. She has such a kind heart and her transformation scenes are so magical! ✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:* \\(◕ω◕✿)/ :*･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧\n\nWhat kind of books do you enjoy reading? I'm always looking for new things to read! ฅ(＾・ω・＾ฅ)"
