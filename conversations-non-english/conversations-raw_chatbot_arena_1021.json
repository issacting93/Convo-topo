This is just a simple example to get you started with building and training AI models in Python."

      "content": "The code you provided contains some invalid characters. However, assuming that you are trying to evaluate the accuracy of a model on test data using NumPy, the corrected code would be:\n\n```\n# Evaluate the model on the test data\naccuracy = np.mean(np.equal(predicted_labels, true_labels), axis=1)\nprint(\"Model accuracy: \", accuracy)\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.equal(predicted_labels, true_labels)` will return a boolean array indicating whether the predicted labels match the true labels. The `np.mean()` function is then used to calculate the accuracy of the model by taking the mean of the boolean values along the `axis=1` direction. Finally, the accuracy is printed to the console using the `print()` function. Note that you will need to replace `predicted_labels` and `true_labels` with the actual predicted and true labels of your model."
