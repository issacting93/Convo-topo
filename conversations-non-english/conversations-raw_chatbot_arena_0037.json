Eating meat is not necessary for human survival, and it is possible for a person to thrive on a plant-based diet. In fact, many people choose to follow a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle for a variety of reasons, including health, environmental, and ethical concerns. It is important to make sure that you are getting enough nutrients on a plant-based diet, such as protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins. A registered dietitian or doctor can help you create a nutritious plant-based diet that meets your needs.</p></div></div></div><div>\n</div></div>"
