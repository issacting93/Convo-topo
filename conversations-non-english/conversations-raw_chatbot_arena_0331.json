      "content": "Ways to improve the world include donating money, volunteering time, or creating a business that benefits society. All of these actions have the potential to improve people's lives, but it can be hard to measure their impact. If you donate to a charitable organization, for example, it's difficult to know how much of the funds are spent on programming versus administration. The same is true for any business outcome you want to measure.\n\nIn order to improve the world in a meaningful way, it's important to measure your impact and share that information with others. If you want to help people, for example, you might start a non-profit organization or create a technology business that solves a problem affecting society. This provides a clear measure of impact and allows you to tie your impact to specific benefits.\n\nIf you want to improve the world in a sustainable way, the first step is to measure your impact and share that information with others."

      "content": "The Halo video games take place in the distant future of the human-Covenant war, in the inner planet of a galaxy known as the Reach. The protagonist of the story, a soldier of the covenant, is Master Chief. The Master Chief was the first Spartan-IIIA, and the main objective of the game is to find and kill the creator of the Covenant, the Prophet of Truth.\n\nThe Master Chief's teammates include the Arbiter, a powerful figure charged with judging the worth of potential Spartans; and a Na'vi named Callan. The Arbiter and Callan both play major roles in the plot, and both fall in love with each other.\n\nThe story takes place across three games. The first game, released in 2001, follows the Master Chief as he is sent to a planet called Reach to investigate a series of disappearances. The second game, released in 2004, follows the Master Chief and the Arbiter on a mission to destroy the Prophet of Truth on the Covenant homeworld, while the third game, released in 2016, follows the Arbiter and Callan as they search for a cure to a viral infection that is spreading throughout the Covenant ship."
