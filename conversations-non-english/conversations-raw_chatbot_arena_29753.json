It was proposed by Nobel Prize-winning physicist William Shockley, who argued that any technology that becomes more efficient than a certain rate will eventually become too expensive to maintain.\nThe ceiling was originally called the \"Shockley-Queisser limit\" because it was based on the work of two physicists, William Shockley and Robert Queisser. However, the term has since been widely adopted and is now used more broadly to describe any technological limit that limits the rate of progress in a field."
