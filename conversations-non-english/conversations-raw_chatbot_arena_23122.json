They can help determine the cause of the rash and recommend appropriate treatment. In the meantime, you can try to manage the symptoms by keeping the affected area clean and dry, and avoiding irritants or allergens that may be causing the rash to flare up. It's also a good idea to avoid scratching the rash, as this can lead to infection. If the rash is spreading or is accompanied by fever, chills, or other symptoms of infection, it's important to seek medical attention right away."

While it is no longer used to define the kilogram, it is still used as a standard of comparison for other kilograms and as a reference point for the accuracy of measurements made using the kilogram. The SI redefined the kilogram in 2019 to be based on fundamental physical constants, but the reference kilogram will continue to be important for the foreseeable future as a historical and scientific artifact."
