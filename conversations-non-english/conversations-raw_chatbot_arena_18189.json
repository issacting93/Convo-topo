Hwoarang is leaning against his motorcycle, arms folded. Jin walks in, notices Hwoarang and stops in his tracks. They stare at each other for a beat.]\n\nJin: You looking for another fight?\n\nHwoarang: Maybe. Depends on if you're still mad about last time. \n\nJin: I'm always up for a rematch.  [Cracks his knuckles]\n\nHwoarang: [Chuckles] You never could let things go.\n\n[They start circling each other, sizing the other up. Hwoarang makes the first move with a spinning kick which Jin blocks. They exchange a flurry of punches and kicks, evenly matched. The fighting is intense but controlled.] \n\nHwoarang: You've improved. Been training hard?\n\nJin: Maybe you're just getting slow.\n\nHwoarang: In your dreams! [Sweeps Jin's legs out from under him. Jin falls but quickly recovers.]\n\nJin: Lucky shot. [Jin rushes at Hwoarang, who sidesteps and sticks out his arm to flip Jin onto his back]\n\nHwoarang: Give it up, you'll never beat me. [Hwoarang turns and starts walking away] See you at the next tournament.  If you make it that far.\n\nJin: [Yells after him] This isn't over! We'll finish this fight when it really matters!\n\n[Hwoarang stops and looks over his shoulder, a grin on his face. He mounts his motorcycle and drives off. Jin gets up, wiping a trickle of blood from his mouth, eyes burning with determination. Scene ends.]"

      "content": "Here is my advice for someone struggling to concentrate:\n\n•Minimize distractions. Find a quiet, distraction-free place to work. Put away your phone and other electronics. Let people around you know that you do not want to be disturbed.\n\n•Focus on one thing at a time. Don't try to multi-task, switch between tasks frequently, or juggle too many things at once. Focus your attention on one priority or task.\n\n•Take regular breaks. Studying or working for prolonged periods without breaks decreases your concentration. Take short breaks every 50-90 minutes to recharge and renew your focus. Even taking short walking breaks can help.\n\n•Start with the most important task. Pick the high-priority or most difficult task and dive into that first. Once you are fully focused, you will build momentum to continue concentrating. Leave easier or less important tasks for later. \n\n•Remove clutter and tidy your space. A messy, disorganized environment scatters your focus and is distracting. Spend a few minutes organizing your space before starting an activity that requires concentration. \n\n•Plan your tasks in advance. Having a clear plan or roadmap for what you need to accomplish helps provide direction and focus. Even loosely outlining your tasks, priorities, and schedule will help give your mind needed structure. \n\n•Take care of yourself. Getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, reducing stress, and exercising regularly increase your ability to concentrate. Your physical wellbeing contributes greatly to your cognitive functions like focus and attention span.\n\n•Consider mindfulness practices. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, and mindfulness can strengthen your focus and concentration over time. Even brief periods of mindfulness, like 60-90 seconds of meditation or deep breathing, can help center your mind.\n\nWith regular practice of these tips, you can strengthen your concentration and focus. But be patient and kind with yourself, as no one's concentration is perfect all the time. You've got this!"
