      "content": "The moon is approximately 240,000 miles from the earth.  It takes 24 hours for the moon to orbit the earth. The gravitational forces between the moon and the earth cause the tides in the ocean.  The tides in the ocean are called the tidal cycle.  It consists of the phases of new, full, half-full, quarter-full, and new.  The gravitational forces are most effective when the moon is closest to the earth, thus causing the largest tides when the moon is full."
