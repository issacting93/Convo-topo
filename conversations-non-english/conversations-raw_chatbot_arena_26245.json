However, it is not uncommon for petting zoos to take steps to remove cow pats from their facilities in order to maintain a clean and safe environment for visitors. This may include regularly cleaning and maintaining the grass and ground surfaces, or using other methods to remove cow pats from the area."

Yes, it is possible for people to give cows pats at a petting zoo, as long as they follow the rules and guidelines set by the zoo and take appropriate precautions to ensure their safety and the safety of the cows. Some petting zoos may have designated areas or staff members available to supervise and assist with patting the cows, while others may simply allow visitors to approach the cows at their own risk. It is important to always follow the rules and guidelines of the petting zoo, and to be respectful and careful when interacting with the animals."
