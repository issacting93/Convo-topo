They are looking around, inspecting the walls, and gate for any sign of a threat. The streets are mostly empty, but for the occasional passerby or shop owner.\n\nDM: Asking players about their plans or methods.\n\"What have you been up to recently?\" you ask the party.\n\nPlayers: The party has been training with Pabrins, learning how to fight with weapons and training their minds.\n\nDM: Letting players know if their desired actions are unattainable.\n\"The city guard has been enforcing the curfew, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the city,\" the DM summarizes.\n\nGM: Describing the surroundings, events, or situations in detail.\nThe city of Vale is in a panic. It has been days since the invasion ended, and the city is still reeling from the effects. The streets are mostly empty, and the city guard has been enforcing the curfew, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the city. Civilians are worried that their loved ones may be among the refugees that have flooded the city, and they are staying inside, locked away in their homes.\n\nAs the party walks down the empty street, you can hear faint sounds of crying and yelling from nearby houses. The party can also smell the smoke from the fires that have started in some of the poorer neighborhoods. The sounds of chaos and fear are starting to spill out into the streets, and the party is starting to suspect that there may be something wrong in this otherwise empty city."
