You are well versed in the newest Flutter developments, including using Dart 3 code and using material 3 widgets. Write the code for a page that allows the user to search a database of \"cards\". This page should have a search box at the top that makes it clear that the user can type in that box and search for a \"card\". There should also be a button at the bottom that offers to take the user to a random \"card\"."

Here's an example code for a Flutter page that allows the user to search a database of \"cards\":\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nclass CardSearchPage extends StatefulWidget {\n  @override\n  _CardSearchPageState createState() => _CardSearchPageState();\n}\n\nclass _CardSearchPageState extends State<CardSearchPage> {\n  String _searchQuery = '';\n\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Scaffold(\n      appBar: AppBar(\n        title: Text('Card Search'),\n        centerTitle: true,\n      ),\n      body: Column(\n        children: [\n          Padding(\n            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n            child: TextField(\n              decoration: InputDecoration(\n                hintText: 'Search for a card...',\n                prefixIcon: Icon(Icons.search),\n              ),\n              onChanged: (value) {\n                setState(() {\n                  _searchQuery = value.toLowerCase();\n                });\n              },\n            ),\n          ),\n          Expanded(\n            child: ListView.builder(\n              itemCount: cards.length,\n              itemBuilder: (context, index) {\n                final card = cards[index];\n                if (_searchQuery.isNotEmpty &&\n                    !card.title.toLowerCase().contains(_searchQuery)) {\n                  return SizedBox.shrink();\n                }\n                return ListTile(\n                  title: Text(card.title),\n                  onTap: () {\n                    // Navigate to card details page\n                  },\n                );\n              },\n            ),\n          ),\n          Padding(\n            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),\n            child: ElevatedButton(\n              onPressed: () {\n                // Navigate to random card details page\n              },\n              child: Text('Random Card'),\n            ),\n          ),\n        ],\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass Card {\n  final String title;\n  final String description;\n\n  Card({required this.title, required this.description});\n}\n\nfinal List<Card> cards = [\n  Card(\n      title: 'Card 1',\n      description: 'This is the description for card 1.'),\n  Card(\n      title: 'Card 2',\n      description: 'This is the description for card 2.'),\n  Card(\n      title: 'Card 3',\n      description: 'This is the description for card 3.'),\n];\n```\n\nIn this example, the page consists of an `AppBar`, a search box `TextField`, a `ListView` of cards that are filtered based on the search query, and a button that takes the user to a random card. The `Card` class is just a simple data class that holds the card's `title` and `description`.\n\nTo filter the cards based on the search query, we use the `ListView.builder`'s `itemBuilder` callback to check whether each card's `title` contains the search query. If it doesn't, we return a `SizedBox.shrink()` widget, which has zero height and width and effectively removes the card from the list. If the search query is empty or the card's title contains the search query, we return a `ListTile` widget that displays the card's `title`.\n\nTo handle navigating to the card details page or the random card details page, you can use the `Navigator.push` method and pass in the appropriate `Route`."

The default alignment for the title in an `AppBar` is left-aligned, and this behavior has been consistent in all versions of Flutter.\n\nThe `centerTitle` parameter only controls the alignment of the `title` widget horizontally within the `AppBar`. If `centerTitle` is set to `true`, the `title` widget will be centered horizontally in the `AppBar`. If `centerTitle` is set to `false`, the `title` widget will be left-aligned in the `AppBar`.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with the title alignment in your `AppBar`, you might want to check your `AppBar` code and make sure that the `centerTitle` parameter is set to `true`."

Flutter 3.10 does not exist, and there is no version of Flutter that has been released with that version number.\n\nTo answer your question more accurately, the `centerTitle` named parameter has been part of the `AppBar` widget in Flutter for a long time, and it is not a new addition. It has been available since the earliest versions of Flutter and is still available in the latest stable version of Flutter (as of September 2021).\n\nThe `centerTitle` parameter controls whether the `title` widget is horizontally centered within the `AppBar` or left-aligned. If `centerTitle` is set to `true`, the `title` widget will be centered horizontally in the `AppBar`. If `centerTitle` is set to `false`, the `title` widget will be left-aligned in the `AppBar`.\n\nI apologize for any confusion my previous response may have caused."
