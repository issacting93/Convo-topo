      "content": "To solve the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 by the quadratic formula, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Factor the quadratic expression to make it easier to solve. In this case, we can factor the expression into (x - 4)(x - 3) = 0.\n2. Use the quadratic formula to find the solutions of the equation. The quadratic formula is x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -8, and c = 12. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nx = (-(-8) +/- sqrt((-8)^2 - 4(1)(12)))/2(1)\n\nx = (8 +/- sqrt(64 - 12))/2\n\nx = (8 +/- sqrt(52))/2\n\nx = (8 +/- 7)/2\n\nx = 15 +/- 7\n\n3. Check the solutions to make sure they solve the original equation. Substituting the solutions back into the original equation, we get:\n\n(15 +/- 7)^2 - 8(15 +/- 7) + 12 = 0\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n(15 +/- 7)^2 - 120 + 90 + 12 = 0\n\n(15 +/- 7)^2 - 21 + 90 = 0\n\n(15^2 +/- 14*7^2) - 21 + 90 = 0\n\n1800 +/- 1064 = 0\n\nThis means that the solutions are not real numbers, which means that there are no real solutions to the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0."
