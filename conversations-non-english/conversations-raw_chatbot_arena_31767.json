      "content": "Please rewrite this passage more concisely: Organic Chemistry is notoriously hard. When I went to University, I heard a lot of complaints about it from other students.  There were only a handful of classes like these that would wipe out a third or more of the class.  In one or more of my 1st or 2nd year engineering classes, the class average on a few exams were as low as 35% so they implemented a curve in order to not fail everyone, but to fail a set amount of students based on the curve.  I took the hit a couple of times and got kicked out of Engineering school. When I applied for an appeal, the department head brought up our eldest brother's name and essentially asked why I couldn't be more like him (I believe, our bro got accepted into masters degree program in Electrical Engineering).  So the point I'm making is that I had no idea that you went and started to take Organic Chemistry, so good on you for even getting that far!  I still don't know how you did it with doing that well with your classes. I only succeeded to that level with a computer programming class (with a language that I self-studied already) and another single class that I took by itself over the summer session. Everything else I couldn't learn at the pace and the method that the professor teaches. "

      "content": "Organic Chemistry is known for being difficult, with many students expressing their struggles in class. Only a few classes have such a high failure rate, which led to a curve in order to fail a set number of students. I took the hit a few times and was kicked out of Engineering school. However, I admire your determination in taking Organic Chemistry, which is a challenging subject. I only succeeded in my classes due to my self-study of a computer programming language and a single summer class. Everything else was difficult to learn at the pace and method of the professor's teaching."
