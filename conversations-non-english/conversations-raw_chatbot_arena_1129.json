Her emerald green eyes sparkled with a fierce determination, and her thick, curly hair was tied back in a tight braid. Despite her intimidating appearance, Khana was a caring and nurturing wife, always eager to help her husband in any way she could. She loved nothing more than spending time with him, exploring the rugged terrain of their homeland and enjoying hearty meals of roasted meat and hearty vegetables. Khana was a true warrior, both in body and in spirit, and her husband was proud to have her by his side."
