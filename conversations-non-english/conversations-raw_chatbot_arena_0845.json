      "content": "llama.cpp is a large artificial intelligence program written in C++ by Kevin Murphy. It was publicly released on December 20, 2022. It can be downloaded from GitHub here: https://github.com/kevinmccoymurphy/llama.cpp\n\nLLAMA stands for Large Language Model ArticIal Network. It is a deep learning model capable of understanding natural language and written text. The model is trained on a large corpus of data, and can be used for text generation, question answering, and semantic parsing. The code is open source and available on Github.\n\nLLAMA can be used to generate text, given a prompt. For example, if I ask LLAMA to generate a poem about the Serengeti, it generates the following:\n\nI saw three lions today,\n  playing in theclear,\n  Dancing through the grass.\n  Was this at all strange?\n  No, for I know\n  That lions can dance."
