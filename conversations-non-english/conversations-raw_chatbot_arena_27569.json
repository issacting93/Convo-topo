      "content": "My ex and I used to live together. Our relationship was pretty toxic, and made me have a few panic attacks. She constantly made me feel that I wasn't enough, and that I wasn't giving her enough attention, and that I made her feel bad. I also felt that she did not respect my boundaries. All this stressed me a lot, because none of those were my intentions and I was just overwhelmed because of my job. I broke up with her a few months ago, and she moved out. However, the flat still gives me a lot of stress. I also noticed that sending a voice message to the girl I'm currently seeing made my body freeze a bit, because often time when I would send it to my ex she would complain about the content of the message or the tone of my voice. I'm unsure how to cope with this."

It's important to take care of yourself and find ways to manage your emotions in this situation. One way to do this is to try to reframe your thoughts and beliefs about the situation. Instead of focusing on the negative aspects of your past relationship and the flat, try to focus on the positive aspects of your current relationship and the future.\n\nIt's also important to set boundaries with your ex, especially if she is continuing to contact you and making you feel uncomfortable. You can politely let her know that you would prefer not to receive any more messages from her and that you would like to focus on your current relationship.\n\nAs for the fear of sending voice messages to your current partner, it may be helpful to try to confront your fears and practice sending messages in a safe and controlled environment. You can also try to focus on your message rather than your ex and try to be mindful of your tone of voice.\n\nIt's also important to be kind to yourself and to seek support from friends, family or a therapist if needed."
