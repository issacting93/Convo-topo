      "content": "Coffee is believed to have originated in the highlands of Ethiopia, where it was consumed due to its energizing effects by the locals. Then, it spread to the middle east, where it was grown and traded, and by the 16th century, it had reached Europe, where it became popular as a beverage. During the colonial era, it was introduced to the south and central America, where it was grown in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, which are now among the largest coffee producers in the world. Now, coffee is a global industry, consumed by millions of people every day as a morning pick-me-up, and social drink."

      "content": "African origins\nWhilst the exact origins of coffee aren’t clear, there are some popular myths and legends surrounding its discovery.\nOur favourite story is that it was discovered by an Ethiopian goatherd in the 10th century, who noticed his goats were full of energy and had trouble sleeping after eating the red berries of a certain bush! He tried the berries himself, before sharing them with some monks, who boiled the berries with some water to make a powerful stimulant drink to keep them awake during lengthy prayer sessions.\nOther Roman and Arabian legends point to coffee being discovered much earlier – both mention a black, bitter beverage with magical stimulating powers.\nIn reality, all we know for sure is that coffee is indigenous to the Kaffa region of modern day Ethiopia, and that Yemeni traders first took it from there across the Arabian peninsula sometime around the start of the 12th century. By the 15th century, it was being cultivated in Yemen, and people had begun to roast the beans, to create a primitive form of the drink we know and love today.\n\nMiddle Eastern Expansion\nFrom Yemen, coffee spread out North, across the Middle East, and by the 16th century, it has become a popular drink in Persia, Syria, Egypt and Turkey.\nThe first coffee houses had also begun to spring up, and quickly found favour as social centres, where people would gather to watch music, enjoy entertainment, share information and discuss important issues.\nWord about coffee quickly spread, as pilgrims from all over the world going to Mecca discovered the drink for the first time. It wasn’t long before news about coffee reached European ears…\n\nCoffee comes to Europe\nEuropean travellers and merchants first brought coffee back from the Near East at the end of the 16th century, and by the 17th century, it was becoming popular across Italy, Germany, France and England.\nHowever, coffee wasn’t without its opponents – when North African traders first brought coffee to Venice in around 1600, the Catholic church were vehemently opposed to it, and made appeals to the Pope to ban the drink. Thankfully, the Pope insisted that he tried coffee before making a decision, and liked it so much that he gave it full Papal approval!\nJust as they had in the Arab world, hundreds of coffee houses sprang up in major cities across Europe, and quickly became important centres for the discussion and development of new political and religious ideas. In England, they became so influential that Charles II tried to ban them in 1675 – but protests were so severe that the ban was repealed after just 11 days.\nWithin 100 years, coffee had become immensely popular across the continent, and the European powers started looking at how they could wrestle the trade monopoly on coffee away from the Arab world.\n\nTo the new world\nEuropean traders soon began taking coffee with them to the far reaches of their empires. The Dutch were the first to start growing it, establishing estates in Sri Lanka, Ceylon and Java in the 17th century.\nThe French and British followed suit, creating plantations in the Caribbean, before the Spanish and Portuguese introduced it to their colonies in South America.\nIt was the British who first exported coffee to the American colonies in the mid 17th century, although it didn’t become popular until the American Revolution, when excessive taxes on tea turned coffee into the patriots drink!"

      "content": "The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. Coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a similar way to how it is prepared now in Arabia. \n\nAccounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea. One account credits Muhammad Ibn Sa'd for bringing the beverage to Aden from the African coast. Other early accounts say Ali ben Omar of the Shadhili Sufi order was the first to introduce coffee to Arabia. \n\nBy the 16th century, coffee had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa. The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East (back then Ottoman Empire) brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600. \n\nWith the introduction of coffee in South America, rapid growth in coffee production in the continent during the second half of the 19th century was matched by growth in consumption in developed countries, though nowhere has this growth been as pronounced as in the United States, where a high rate of population growth was compounded by doubling of per capita consumption between 1860 and 1920. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the world.  As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total."

By 16th century, coffee drinking spreads to Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and North Africa, and eventually spread to Europe. Through advertising efforts by the British East India Company, coffee briefly became popular in England and the Americas in the 17th and 18th century. Coffee is first mass-produced in Brazil in early 19th century, and by the 20th and 21st century coffee became the most popular drink in the world and a vital cash crop for many countries."
