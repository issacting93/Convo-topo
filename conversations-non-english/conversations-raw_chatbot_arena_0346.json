Although the front of a boat is exposed to the elements more than the back, the back of the boat is where the rudder and the propulsion equipment is located. If a storm were to approach the boat from the rear, the boat owner would have the option of tacking (swinging the rudder to change the direction of movement of the boat) or he could reduce engine power. Reducing engine power in a storm would increase the chance of being swamped. Therefore, it is safer to reinforce the front of the boat."

      "content": "vivor bias is a concept in statistics. It describes the situation where only observations of a phenomenon that have \"survived\" to examine are collected and reported. In this example, only observations of boats that came back with damage on the front are reported to the boat owner. There may be other observations of boats that were caught in storms that had no damage on the front but did have damage on the back, which was not reported. If we collected and analyzed all observations (regardless of the location of damage), we would conclude that the risk of being swamped is not the same for the front as it is for the back."
