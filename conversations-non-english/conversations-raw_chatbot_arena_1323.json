She quickly grabbed a roll of pita bread and sliced it into small pieces, thinking that it would do the trick.</p><p>As she was slicing the bread, she noticed that the farmer was watching her with a puzzled look on his face. \"What's with the bread?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I'm making your lunch,\" the farmer's wife replied.</p><p>But the farmer shook his head. \"No, no,\" he said. \"I mean, why are you using pita bread? That's not the kind of bread we usually have for lunch.\"</p><p>The farmer's wife felt embarrassed and apologized for her mistake. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she said. \"I just didn't have any other bread and I thought it would work.\"</p><p>But the farmer was not satisfied with the answer. \"No, no,\" he said. \"I need my lunch to be perfect. I have a big meeting with the townspeople later today and I want to make sure that I impress them with my lunch.\"</p><p>So, the farmer's wife quickly grabbed a loaf of bread from the kitchen and sliced it into thin pieces. She then placed a slice of cheese and a slice of ham on each slice of bread, and put them in a container to take with him to the meeting. When the farmer returned home, he was met with a delicious lunch that he had prepared himself.</p><p>From then on, the farmer's wife made sure to always have the right kind of bread on hand when the farmer needed it for his lunches. And the farmer was always grateful for the delicious lunches that his wife prepared for him.</p></div></div></div><div></div></div>"
