      "content": "Based on the information provided, it sounds like X refers to a town located within the Fläming hill range and in the centre of the High Fläming Nature Park in Germany, where great bustards (large birds) live on the plains north of the town. However, the name of the specific town is not mentioned. Without more details about the name or location of the town, I can't determine what X refers to."

      "content": "Okay, with the additional information that 14 surrounding villages were incorporated into X in 2003, it sounds like X likely refers to a larger town within the Fläming hill range that is now the central town of the area after absorbing those villages. The most likely possibilities would be:\n\n- Bad Belzig - A town located in the Fläming hill range that incorporated several smaller villages in 2003. It is also near where great bustards live.\n\n- Wiesenburg - Another town located within the Fläming hills that annexed neighboring villages in 2003. It is also located near habitat for great bustards.\n\n- Niemegk - A town in the Fläming range that consolidated with surrounding villages in 2003 and is close to where great bustards are found. \n\nWithout more details, I can't say definitively which of these towns X refers to, but based on the clues, those are some likely candidates. Let me know if any additional information is available to help determine the exact town."
