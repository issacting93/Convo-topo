But you know, I don't want you to be uncomfortable or anything. You can sit in the front seat if you want.\nLeon: Oh no, I don't want to be a bother. I'm just happy to be here.\nLarry: Well, it's no bother at all. I don't mind. It's the least I can do.\nLeon: Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.\nLarry: No problem. Let's go.\nLeon: Where are we headed?\nLarry: Just a little detour. I have to drop by my house for a minute.\nLeon: Oh, okay. I don't mind. I'm just happy to be here.\nLarry: Alright. Let's go.\nLeon: Hey, Larry, while we're on the topic of driving. I have to ask you something. How come you always drive so slow? It's like you're intentionally aggravating me.\nLarry: Oh, come on, Leon. You know me. I'm just a laid-back kind of guy. I don't like to drive too fast.\nLeon: Well, I don't get it. Why do you always have to drive so slow?\nLarry: It's just my style. I like to keep things relaxed.\nLeon: Well, I don't like it. I feel like I'm being dragged along, you know?\nLarry: Well, I don't want you to feel that way. I'm just trying to make you comfortable.\nLeon: Well, it's not working. I don't like it.\nLarry: Okay, buddy. Fine. I'll drop you off at home and I'll go back to my own car.\nLeon: No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, I'm just going to sit in the back seat. I don't want you to drive me. I don't like it.\nLarry: Alright, man. I understand. But I'm going to drop you off at home and I'll go back to my own car.\nLeon: No, no, no. I don't want you to do that. I don"
