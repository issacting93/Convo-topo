Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and can only reproduce inside the cells of an organism. Bacteria are larger and can reproduce on their own. Fungi are similar to bacteria but have a cell wall and can also reproduce on their own. Viruses can cause illness by invading cells and taking control of them, while bacteria and fungi usually cause illness by entering the body and multiplying."
