It is important to remember that prison guards are there to maintain order and safety within the prison, and they are responsible for the well-being and security of all inmates. It is not appropriate to resort to violence against them, even if one feels mistreated or disrespected. It is important to find other ways to address any issues or concerns one may have, such as through communication with guards or through the prison's official channels."

The government prosecutes the case, but it is the judge and jury who decide on the verdict and sentence. It is up to the judge and jury to decide on the appropriate penalty for the crime, based on the evidence presented in court and the applicable laws. It is possible for the government to make a recommendation to the court, but ultimately the court has the final say in the matter."

The decision to send someone to death row is made by the criminal justice system, which includes the court and the judge. The court is responsible for determining the guilt of the defendant and the appropriate sentence, and the judge has the authority to impose a sentence of death if it is appropriate under the law and the facts of the case. The Governor has no role in the decision to send someone to death row."

The Supreme Court is an independent branch of government, and its role is to interpret the law and ensure that it is applied fairly and consistently. The Supreme Court can overturn decisions made by the Governor or other branches of government if they believe that the law has been applied incorrectly or if the decision is in violation of the Constitution. The Supreme Court does not always agree with the Governor or other branches of government, and it is not the Governor's role to direct the Supreme Court's decisions."
