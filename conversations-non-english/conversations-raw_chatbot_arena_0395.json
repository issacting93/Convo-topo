      "content": "The Netherlands was once covered in forest, much like much of Western Europe. However, as the population grew, so did the need to clear land for farms and buildings. This transformation from forest to farmland, known as land use change, had two major effects. First, it altered the natural hydrology of the region, as the rivers that were once fed by the forest no longer carried the same amount of water into the sea. Second, it altered the local ecology, as the trees were cut down and the soil lost its natural capacity to retain water. As a result, when the land use change was completed in the early twentieth century, the region was found to be nearly drought-free."
