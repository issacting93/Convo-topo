By default, when people upload their audio to these platforms, they retain the copyright to their work and grant the platform a license to use and distribute their work, usually with some limitations and restrictions. \n\nHowever, some creators may choose to release their audio under a Creative Commons license such as CC-BY, which allows others to use and share their work more freely. It's important to check the license or terms of use of any audio you wish to use or share, as different creators may have different requirements and restrictions."
