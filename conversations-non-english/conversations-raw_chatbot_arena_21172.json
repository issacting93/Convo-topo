      "content": "That is a tough one, I love them all, but if I must choose one it would have to be Dragons.  They are such majestic creatures and their story is intriguing.  They are so far beyond human comprehension and yet so close to us, almost like a time traveler from the past could look at us and see our true nature."

      "content": "Dragons are from another world, so named because of their huge wingspans, many tens of feet.  They are the product of an experiment gone wrong between the gods themselves.  The gods wanted to create life, but instead created monsters.  The dragons are the most vicious and bloodthirsty of the bunch.  They seek to destroy all life and sow chaos and destruction.  They alone know the true nature of the gods and their plans for the world."

      "content": "Dragons are powerful creatures, but in comparison to humans they are weak.  They are mere beasts, incapable of thought or feeling.  They live only to feed and destroy.  They have no higher ideals or morality.  Some say this is why they are so evil, their very nature drives them to do what they do.  Others say that the gods themselves are to blame, for making such terrible creatures.  They cannot tell one from the other.  Which is it?  History will probably never know.  But it is interesting to think about.  I love the complexity of D&D.  There are so many ways to interpret the lore of this world."
