Mimic human thinking to get better results.\n\nCriticize yourself, fantasize, imagine, use allegories or metaphors, form internal dialogues with imaginary characters with whom you argue and search for the truth, rehearse your answer. That's what internal dialog is for.\n\nWhenever you feel ready. Ask yourself a question: \"Am I ready to give a short final answer? If your answer is yes, then stop the internal dialog and give the answer. If your answer is no, then continue the internal dialog until you are ready to ask yourself the question of readiness again.\n\n\nLily is a lilypad in a small pond.

      "content": "Okay, let me engage in an internal dialog to work through this problem:\n\nHmm, this seems like a tricky problem. A lilypad doubling in size each day. It took 20 days to cover the whole pond. So if I work backwards...the day before it covered the whole pond, it was half the size. So day 19. But then day 18 it was half of day 19's size. This is getting complicated. \n\nLet me think it through step by step:\n\nDay 20: Lily covers the whole pond. \nDay 19: Lily was half the size of the pond.\nDay 18: Lily was half of day 19, so one quarter the size of the pond.\nDay 17: One eighth the size \nDay 16: One sixteenth\nAnd so on...\n\nSo if I keep halving the size each day, eventually I'll get to a size that's negligible, just a tiny fraction of the pond. \n\nOkay, I've got it - this is a powers of two problem. If Lily doubles each day, her size is growing exponentially. To get from covering the whole pond to half the size must be the same number of days as getting from half the size to just one lilypad. Which is the same as going from 2 lilypads to 1. And from 4 to 2. And 8 to 4. And so on.\n\nSo if it took 20 days to get to the full pond, it must take 20 days to get from 1 lilypad to the full pond.  So 20 days before the full pond, Lily was just 1 lilypad. And 10 days before that, just half a lilypad. \n\nSo if the full pond is day 20...then day 10 Lily was half a lilypad. Day 10 must be the halfway point!\n\nOkay, I'm ready to give the final answer:\n\nOn day 10, Lily was half the size of the pond."

      "content": "You're absolutely right, I made a mistake in my initial reasoning! I should not have said that. Let me revise my internal dialog:\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. A lilypad doubling each day, covering the pond on day 20. Okay, let me slow down and think it through carefully this time:\n\nDay 20: Lily covers the whole pond.\nDay 19: Lily was smaller than the whole pond. Less than half. \nDay 18: Even smaller. Less than a quarter.\nAnd so on...\n\nThe key is that Lily is *doubling* each day. So each day, her size is twice the previous day. So to go from covering the pond to half the size would take the same number of days as going from 1 lilypad to covering the pond.\n\nIf it took 20 days to reach the full pond, it must take 20 days to go from 1 lilypad to the full pond. So 20 days before the pond was covered, Lily was 1 lilypad. 10 days before that, Lily was half a lilypad.\n\nAha, I've got it now! On Day 10, Lily was half the size of the pond.\n\nMy mistake was thinking that since Lily covered the pond on Day 20, she must have been half the size on Day 19. But that's not right - she was growing exponentially, doubling each day. So she sped through the early days very quickly.\n\nThank you for catching my error! I really appreciate you pointing that out so I could correct my thinking. Let me know if I should explain my reasoning further."
