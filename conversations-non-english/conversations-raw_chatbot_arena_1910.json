She falls down a rabbit hole and enters a strange and surreal world full of talking animals and eccentric characters. In the sequel, \"Through the Looking Glass,\" Alice enters a fantastical world on the other side of a mirror, but she still does not go to the moon."

Lewis Carroll was actually the pen name of the author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, who wrote the \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" and \"Through the Looking Glass\" books. However, some scholars have suggested that the character of the White Rabbit may have been inspired by a real-life pet rabbit that Dodgson knew, and some of the other characters may have been based on people he knew as well."
