Positions:\n* Define your entry and exit criteria for the trade. For example, you may want to enter a long position when the RSI overbought condition is detected, and exit the trade when the RSI oversold condition is detected.\n* Assess the RSI overbought condition: Look for a high RSI value that indicates a bullish signal. This indicates that the market is overbought at the current price.\n* Look for a high RSI value that indicates a bullish signal: Conversely, a low RSI value that indicates a bearish signal. This indicates that the market may be oversold at the current price.\n* Calculate the RSI oversold condition: Calculate the RSI value oversold for your position. This value should be lower than the RSI overbought condition.\n* Set stop-loss orders: Set stop-loss orders at a reasonable price level to limit potential losses. For example, if the RSI oversold condition is detected, you may want to set a stop loss at a level below your entry criteria.\n2.

This will help you identify potential risks and set appropriate levels of risk.\n* Risk management plan: Develop a risk management plan that outlines your risk tolerance and the strategies you will use to manage your risk.\n4.

These conditions should be based on the RSI overbought and oversold conditions you defined earlier.\n* Integrate these conditions into your trading strategy.
