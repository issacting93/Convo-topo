This can be done via the rEFInd installation program or by editing the EFI boot file directly.\n\nNote that if you remove the Linux boot loader using either of these methods, you may no longer be able to boot Linux. You will need to boot from another installation medium, such as a live USB, live CD, or DVD, and then use a live Linux system to restore the Linux boot loader."
