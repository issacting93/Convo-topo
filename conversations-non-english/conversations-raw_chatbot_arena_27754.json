Can you provide more details about the issue, such as what specific video you are using and how you are experiencing the blurry video? Additionally, have you tried adjusting the settings in the Unity video player to improve the video quality?"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It's possible that the issue with the video flickering could be related to the video's texture filtering settings. The Unity video player may be using different texture filtering options than the native video player.\nYou mentioned trying different texture filtering options, but what exactly did you try? Are you using the same texture filtering options in both the Unity video player and the native video player?\nAlso, have you tried playing the video at a different resolution or frame rate to see if that resolves the issue?\nIf the issue persists, you may want to try using a different video player that is specifically designed for VR, such as the Unreal Engine VR player or the OpenVR video player. These players may have additional features or settings that can help improve the quality of the video playback."
