      "content": "Edith Stein, also known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, was a German-born Catholic nun who was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1998. She is best known for her work in serving the poor and sick, particularly in India.\n\nStein received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1916, and her dissertation focused on the concept of the \"essence\" of the human person. After completing her studies, she began teaching at several universities in Germany.\n\nIt is unclear how Stein became familiar with phenomenology, a philosophical movement that focuses on the study of conscious experience and perception. However, it is possible that she was introduced to the ideas of phenomenologists through her studies in philosophy or through her interactions with other philosophers and scholars.\n\nAfter completing her studies, Stein joined the Catholic Church and became a nun, spending the rest of her life serving the poor and sick in India. Despite her lack of formal training in phenomenology, her work as a nun and her writings on spirituality and the human experience have been influenced by phenomenological ideas."
