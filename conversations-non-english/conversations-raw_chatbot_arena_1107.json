      "content": "It would be helpful to know more about what kind of texts you would like to input and what you want to do with the words that coincide. Here are some ideas for how you might approach this problem:\n\n1.  Input the texts as CSV files, with each text in a separate column.\n2.  Use a regular expression to search for words in each text that match a pattern.\n3.  For each match, store the word and the text it appears in in a list.\n4.  Use a database or other data structure to store the words and their corresponding texts.\n5.  Use a human-powered tool, such as a dictionary, to identify the most common words in each text.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use a regular expression to search for words in two text files:\n\n``` \nimport re\n\n# Search for words in each text file\nfor text in text_files:\n    # Use a regular expression to search for words\n    word_pattern = re.compile(r'\\b[a-z]+ [')\n    match = word_pattern.search(text)\n    if match:\n        # Store the word and the text it appears in in a list\n        words_in_file = [word for word in match.group(0)\n                        if word in word_list]\n        # Use a database or other data structure to store the words and their corresponding texts\n        word_list = {word: text for word, text in zip(words_in_file, word_list)}\n        print(f\"Word {word} in text {text}: {word_list[word]}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"No words in text {text} found with pattern {word_pattern}\")\n```\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the wordlist functions in Python to identify the most common words in two text files:\n\n``` \n# Extract the most common words from each text file\nword_list_file1 = {}\nword_list_file2 = {}\nfor word, text in zip(word_list_file1, word_list_file2):\n    if text in word_list_file1:\n        word_list_file1[text] += 1\n    else:\n        word_list_file2[text] += 1\n\n# Print the most common words in each text file\nfor word, count in word_list_file1.items():\n    print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n\nfor word, count in word_list_file2.items():\n    print(f\"{word}: {count}\")\n```\n\nNote that these are just some examples of how you might approach this problem, and there may be other ways to approach it that you find more efficient or effective. The important thing is to find a solution that meets your specific requirements and works well for your use case."
