To use this move, the Charizard must have access to the Ember move in its move set. If the opponent is a Water-type Pokémon such as Blastoise, Ember will be an effective move as it will have a higher damage output compared to other non-Fire type moves. However, it is important to consider other factors such as the opponent's type, moves it knows, health, and the Pokémon's move set when deciding which move to use."
