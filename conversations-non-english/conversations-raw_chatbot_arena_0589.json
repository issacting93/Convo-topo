      "content": "The first hymn of Rigveda is dedicated to Lord Agni (the god of fire). It is known as the \"Agni Sukta\" and was composed by Rishi Madhucchandas. Here is the hymn in English transliteration:\n\n1. Agnim īḷe purōhitam̐\nYajñasya devam ŗtvijam\nHōtāram̐ ratnad hātamam\n\n2. Agniḥ pūrvebhir rṣibhir\nĪḍyō nūtanair uta\nSa devān eha vakṣati\n\n3. Agna nāya supathā rāye\nAsmān viśvāni deva vayunāni vidvān\nYuyodhy asmaj juhurān̐am eno\nBhūyiṣṭhāṁ te nama uktim vidhema\n\nTranslation:\n\n1. I worship Agni, the high priest of the sacrifice,\nThe divine, the invoker, the best bestower of treasures.\n\n2. Agni has been praised by the ancient Rishis,\nAs well as the recent ones; he leads the gods here (to the ceremony).\n\n3. O Agni, through the good path, lead us to riches,\nKnowing all the divine powers, remove the obstacles.\nTo you who are mighty, we offer our salutations and praises."
