The game is played in teams, with one member of the team trying to guess the codenames of several teams. The spymaster gives a one-word clue to a codenamed word, and the team has to guess which codeword the clue refers to. The game can be played with more or less players, and it's also available as an app for mobile devices. It's a lot of fun and can be played in just a few minutes!"
