      "content": "The lemon (Citrus limon) is a species of small evergreen trees in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to Asia, primarily Northeast India (Assam), Northern Myanmar or China.\n\nIt was introduced into Spain and North Africa sometime between the years 1000 and 1200 ce. It was further distributed through Europe by the Crusaders, who found it growing in Palestine. In 1494 the fruit was being cultivated in the Azores and shipped largely to England. The lemon was thought by 18th-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus to be a variety of citron (Citrus medica), though it is now known to be a separate hybrid species.\n\nThe lemon forms an evergreen spreading bush or small tree, 3–6 meters high if not pruned. Its young oval leaves have a decidedly reddish tint; later they turn green. In some varieties the young branches of the lemon are angular; some have sharp thorns at the axils of the leaves. The flowers have a sweet odour and are solitary or borne in small clusters in the axils of the leaves. Reddish-tinted in the bud, the petals are usually white above and reddish purple below. The fruit is oval with a broad, low, apical nipple and forms 8 to 10 segments. The outer rind, or peel, yellow when ripe and rather thick in some varieties, is prominently dotted with oil glands. The white spongy inner part of the peel, called the mesocarp or albedo, is nearly tasteless and is the chief source of commercial grades of pectin. The seeds are small, ovoid, and pointed; occasionally fruits are seedless. The pulp is decidedly acidic."

I mean, they had to drink something to stay hydrated, right? Maybe they stumbled upon lemons during their conquests and decided to mix it with water and sugar. It's not like they were known for their good deeds anyways. Let's just give them credit for something, eh?"

The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie."

      "content": "A tree is a large, perennial plant with a woody stem and typically many secondary branches. Trees are an important part of the ecosystem - they provide shelter, food, and shade for many animals. They also absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, which is essential for all life on Earth. There are many different kinds of trees - some are coniferous (evergreen), while others are deciduous (lose their leaves in the winter). Some trees are considered to be \"timber\" trees, which are used for wood, while other trees are more decorative. A lemon tree is a tree that produces lemons. Lemons are a citrus fruit that is often used in cooking and baking. The juice from lemons is also used to make lemonade. Lemons are sour and have a strong flavor, so they can be used to add flavor to many dishes. However, it is important to be careful when using lemons in cooking or baking, as the juice can be acidic enough to alter the flavor of a dish if used in too high of quantities."
