Some people believe that ghost ships are cursed, and that they are doomed to sail the seas forever, with no one on board. These stories are often told as cautionary tales to warn people about the dangers of sailing on unoccupied vessels.</p><p>Another possibility is that the boat is a ship that is stuck in a time loop, where it keeps repeating the same journey over and over again. This could be caused by a number of factors, including a natural disaster, such as a storm or an earthquake, or a supernatural phenomenon, such as a time-traveling device.</p><p>It's also possible that the boat is a visual illusion, such as a mirage, and that there is no actual boat present. This could be caused by a number of factors, such as the heat rising off the desert, or a reflection of the boat in the water.</p><p>Overall, there are many possible explanations for why you might see a boat filled of people, yet with no one on board. The most important thing is to stay safe and not get too close to the boat, as it is important to respect the safety of the people who may be on board, even if they are not present in the physical world.</p></div></div></div><div></div></div>"
