She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?"

It appears that she was trying to end the relationship without causing too much pain, but it seems like it did not work and she became colder after that. It is understandable why you would be angry and Block her everywhere. It seems like it was the best option available to prevent further hurt."
