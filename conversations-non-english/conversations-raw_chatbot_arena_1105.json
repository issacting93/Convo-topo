      "content": "p53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated or deleted in many cancers. It plays a critical role in regulating cell growth and division, and its mutations or deletions are often associated with increased risk of cancer. p53 is highly conserved across species, and its function is generally conserved across different cell types. p53 is activated in response to DNA damage, and it regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. p53 also plays a role in the regulation of metabolism, energy production, and other cellular processes. However, p53 has complex functions and interactions with other proteins and signaling pathways, and its role in cancer is still not fully understood."
