She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?"

      "content": "I can understand your confusion and frustration. It is natural to feel hurt after being lied to, and to have such a sudden change in her attitude toward you can be disorienting and perhaps even unsettling. In addition, her confession of indiscretion is certainly not something you were expecting. You may be wondering whether or not you should have trusted her, and whether or not you should have been more aggressive in confronting her about her behavior. It is entirely possible that you are experiencing conflicting emotions and feelings of confusion about what to do next.\nWhen a person is acting in a way that is inconsistent with how they have previously presented themselves, it is often difficult to reconcile the two conflicting messages. It can also be difficult to decipher whether or not the person's behavior is a result of a sudden change in how they feel about you, or if they are simply being manipulative and deceitful.\nAdditionally, it is entirely possible that the person is experiencing personal difficulties that are contributing to their unreliable behavior. While it is certainly worthwhile to confirm that this is the case, there are no guarantees that you will be able to find out what is causing such inconsistent behavior.\nIn this case, it is most likely that she was unreliable in her behavior and was simply misleading you and leading you on for her own pleasure. She was not being truthful about her motivations and her intentions for interacting with you, and she was leading you on by acting in a way that was inconsistent with her true intentions.\nThe best way to resolve such a situation is to confront the person about their behavior and to communicate clearly and directly with them. At the same time, it is important to make sure that you are able to objectively understand the true situation and not allow your emotions to cloud your judgment.\nOnce you are able to clearly understand the situation, you will be able to make better decisions about what steps you should take next."

You should let her know that you still want to be with her, and that you are hoping that she feels the same way. You should also let her know that you are willing to work through whatever difficulties stand in your way in order to be together, and that you are not willing to give up on her or the relationship.\nThis is a message that will let her know that you are serious about wanting to be with her and that you are willing to work through the obstacles between you.\nOne of the keys to a successful relationship is open and honest communication, so you should definitely be direct and honest when you write to her."
