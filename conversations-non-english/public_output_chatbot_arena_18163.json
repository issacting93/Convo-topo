MRCs are used to study the properties of subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. They are typically made of metal, and have a series of small holes or slits that allow particles to enter and be detected by a detector placed inside the MRC.\nIn the context of your conversation, it is possible that Bob is referring to an MRC specifically related to medical research, such as a Medical Research Council.
