      "content": "The joke is a play on words. \"1-1\" is a reference to the score of a draw, which is typically indicated as \"1-1\" in sports. The punchline, \"What was the final result?\" implies that the score was actually 1-1, despite Johnny's excitement about scoring two goals. The joke is funny because it takes the expected outcome of a sports victory and turns it on its head in a unexpected and humorous way."

This is because the first goal scored by Johnny would be followed by a goal scored by the other team, resulting in a final score of 1-1. If Johnny then scored another goal, the final score would be 2-1."

      "content": "Yes, it is possible for a player to score both goals in an association football game and for the final score to be 1-1. This happens when one team scores two goals and the other team scores one goal, resulting in a final score of 2-1. If both goals were scored by the same player, then the final score would be 2-0. However, if the first goal was scored by one team and the second goal was scored by the other team, the final score would be 1-1."
