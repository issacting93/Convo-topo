If you'd like to learn what he believed, I recommend reading letters and notes from his bibliography. If you want an exhaustive documentation of his life, I'd recommend Douglas Southall Freeman's biography of him, which is considered the most comprehensive at over 3500 words long. If you want something more patriotic and entertaining, I'd suggest Mason Weems's biography, which he wrote in 1800 and includes the famous anecdote about Washington and the cherry tree. If you're looking for more critical view of Washington, recent biographies like Alexis Coe’s try to interpret Washington's life through a modern lens. As for meusiums, I'd highly recommend visiting Mount Vernon, his estate in Fairfax County, Virginia, which is home of the Washington Institute."

He also ruined his natural teeth crushing walnut shells, so had dentures made, which included real human teeth, some from the mouths of slaves he owned. History can be quite gruesome."
