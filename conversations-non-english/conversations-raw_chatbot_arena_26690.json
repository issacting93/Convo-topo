      "content": "There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as different people have different sleep patterns and schedules. However, most people find that waking up naturally around 7-8am is the best time to start the day for optimal health. This is when their bodies are still fresh and alert, and they are able to get the most out of their day. If you have trouble waking up, try setting an alarm for a few minutes earlier or later, or try taking a short power nap during the day."

      "content": "A good option to buy a car with 20 000 EUR is a used one or a brand new one. In the case of a used car, you will be able to purchase a vehicle that is still in good condition for a lower price. On the other hand, if you want to purchase a brand new car, you should make sure that you compare prices from different dealerships and choose a vehicle that is within your budget. Additionally, you should also consider factors such as the fuel efficiency, safety ratings, and features of the car before you make a purchase."
