      "content": "To solve the equation x^2 - 125x + 2500 = 0, we can follow these steps:\n1. Factor the equation:\nWe can factor the equation by grouping the terms with the same factors:\nx^2 - 125x + 2500 = (x - 25)(x - 25)\n2. Substitute the roots into the equation:\nWe can substitute these roots into the equation:\nx - 25 = 0\nx - 25 = 0\n3. Check the solutions:\nWe can substitute these solutions back into the original equation to see if they work:\nx^2 - 125x + 2500 = 0\n(x - 25)(x - 25) = 0\nx - 25 = 0 (x = 25)\nSo, x = 25 is a solution.\n4. Check the x-intercepts:\nWe can check the x-intercepts by plugging in the x-coordinate of the roots into the original equation:\nx^2 - 125x + 2500 = 0\n(x - 25)(x - 25) = 0\nx - 25 = 0\nSo, x = 25 is also a solution.\n5. Check the domain and range:\nThe domain of the equation is all real numbers.\nThe range of the equation is all real numbers.\n6. Graph the equation:\nWe can graph the equation using a graphing calculator or by hand.\n7. Check the solutions:\nWe can check the solutions by plugging them back into the original equation:\nx^2 - 125x + 2500 = 0\nx^2 - 125x + 2500 = 0\nx - 25 = 0 (x = 25)\nSo, x = 25 is also a solution.\n8. Solve the equation with a calculator:\nWe can solve the equation using a calculator.\nThe solution is x = 25."
