There is no error in these calculations.\n\nThe reason that you may have received a different result when you tried to evaluate these calculations is that the expression 2+2*2 can be simplified to 2+4, and that result may have been entered into the computer or calculation tool as the final answer. However, the actual value of the expression is 5."

It is also possible that the expressions are not valid under certain conditions, or that the values you have derived may be undefined or不准确.\n\nIf you are confident that there is an error in one of the expressions or if you are unable to derived accurate results from the expressions, please provide more information about the context and setup of the problem, so that we can try to identify the underlying error and provide a solution."
