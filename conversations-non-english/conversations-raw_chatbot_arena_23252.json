It's important to remember that you're not alone in this - everyone experiences financial setbacks from time to time. The best thing you can do is to take some time to process your feelings and then come up with a plan to get back on your feet. There are a number of resources available to help you with this, such as financial counseling and debt relief programs. You can also reach out to friends and family for support. Remember, things will get better. Just take it one day at a time."
