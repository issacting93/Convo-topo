      "content": "1. Pure Risk: This type of risk involves the possibility of loss or damage, but no potential for gain or profit. Examples of pure risk include natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes, as well as illness, car accidents, and death. Pure risks are typically insurable and mitigated through risk management strategies such as insurance or avoidance.\n\n2. Speculative Risk: This type of risk involves the potential for both loss or damage and gain or profit. Examples of speculative risk include investing in the stock market, starting a business, or gambling. Speculative risks are typically not insurable and are often managed through diversification and hedging strategies.\n\n3. Inherent Risk: This type of risk is an inherent part of a particular activity or situation. Examples of inherent risk include the risks associated with owning a manufacturing plant, the risks of mining, or the risks associated with driving a car. Inherent risks are often managed through preventative measures such as safety protocols and risk assessments.\n\n4. Residual Risk: This type of risk is the remaining risk that is present after all other risk management strategies have been implemented. Residual risks are typically small, but they can still pose a threat to an organization or individual. Examples of residual risk include the risk of a cyber attack after implementing cybersecurity measures or the risk of a car accident after practicing safe driving habits. Residual risks can be managed through ongoing risk assessments and monitoring.",
