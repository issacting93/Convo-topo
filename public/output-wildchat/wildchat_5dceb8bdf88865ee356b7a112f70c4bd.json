In the project view, navigate to the `build.gradle` file for your app module (usually located in the app folder).\n3. Look for the `compileSdkVersion` property in the file.\n4. Change the value of `compileSdkVersion` to at least 34 (or the desired version).\n   ```gradle\n   compileSdkVersion 34\n   ```\n5. Save the file.\n\nAfter updating the compileSdkVersion, you might need to update other dependencies, such as androidx.activity, to their corresponding compatible versions. Make sure you check the documentation or release notes for each library or dependency to see if there are any specific versions required for compatibility with the new compileSdkVersion.\n\nOnce you have updated the compileSdkVersion and any other dependencies, you can rebuild your project to apply the changes. Android Studio might prompt you to update other related configurations, such as targetSdkVersion or minSdkVersion, if necessary. Remember to review and adjust these settings accordingly before building and testing your app.",
