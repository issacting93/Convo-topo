Academic research in this area has argued that in a monopolistic environment, leasing dominates selling. Hence, leasing and selling should not co-exist and the firm should concentrate its efforts solely on leasing. We show that the relative profitability of leasing and selling hinges on the rates at which leased and sold units depreciate. In particular, we find that leasing does not dominate selling in all cases; if sold units depreciate at a significantly higher rate than leased units, a monopolistic firm is better off by only selling its product. In addition, we find that if leaded and sold products depreciate at different rates, then the optimal strategy for the firm involves a combination of both leasing and selling. We conclude the paper with an empirical analysis of the depreciation rates of leased and sold units of a popular car model. We find that the depreciation rate of leased cars has been significantly lower than the depreciation rate of sold cars."

To identify executive effects on firms’ effective tax rates, we construct a data set that tracks the movement of 908 executives across firms over time. Results indicate that individual executives play a significant role in determining the level of tax avoidance that firms undertake. The economic magnitude of the executive effects on tax avoidance is large. Moving between the top and bottom quartiles of executives results in approximately an 11 percent swing in GAAP effective tax rates; thus, executive effects appear to be an important determinant in firms’ tax avoidance."

While the existing literature focuses mostly on the effect of informality on firm outcomes, little research has been conducted on how these firms set strategies in response to their external environment. Using data on routes of minibus taxi operators in South Africa, we explore how the external environment informs this strategic choice. Through spatial and regression analysis, we find that firms choose over a spectrum of informality over time and space in response to demand and availability of public infrastructure. Investigating this phenomenon further through interviews with stakeholders throughout the minibus taxi industry, we find that these firms blend formal and informal strategies to maximize their profit-making potential in the face of insufficient infrastructure and economic and physical uncertainty."

Despite their disproportionate share of global trade, MNEs’ input sourcing and final-good production decisions are often studied separately. Using newly merged data on firms’ trade and FDI activity by country, we show that US MNEs are more likely to import not only from the countries in which they have affiliates, but also from other countries within their affiliates’ region. We rationalize these patterns in a unified framework in which firms jointly determine the countries in which to produce final goods, and the countries from which to source inputs. The model generates a new source of scale economies that arises because a firm incurs a country-specific fixed cost that allows all its assembly plants to source inputs from that country. This shared fixed cost across plants creates interdependencies between firms’ assembly and sourcing locations, and leads to non-monotonic responses in third markets to bilateral trade cost changes."

Your use of merged data on firms' trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activities offers a comprehensive understanding of US MNEs' import patterns, not only from countries where they have affiliates but also from other countries within their affiliates' regions. The unified framework you propose, where firms jointly determine production and sourcing countries, elucidates the interdependencies between assembly and sourcing locations. The identification of shared fixed costs across plants highlights the presence of scale economies, adding a new dimension to the study of these complex decision-making processes. I am eager to delve into your research to gain further insights into the non-monotonic responses in third markets resulting from bilateral trade cost changes."

The weighting methods considered include equal weighting of all attributes, two methods for using judgments about the rank ordering of weights, and a method for using judgments about the ratios of weights. The question addressed is: How well does each method perform when based on judgments of attribute weights that are unbiased but subject to random error? To address this question, we employ simulation methods. The simulation results indicate that ratio weights were either better than rank order weights (when error in the ratio weights was small or moderate) or tied with them (when error was large). Both ratio weights and rank order weights were substantially superior to the equal weights method in all cases studied. Our findings suggest that it will usually be worth the extra time and effort required to assess ratio weights. In cases where the extra time or effort required is too great, rank order weights will usually give a good approximation to the true weights. Comparisons of the two rank-order weighting methods favored the rank-order-centroid method over the rank-sum method. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The comparison of various weighting methods, including equal weighting, rank order weights, and ratio weights, provides valuable insights into their performance when based on judgments subject to random error. The simulation results reveal that both ratio weights and rank order weights outperform the equal weights method, with ratio weights being particularly effective when error in the weights is small or moderate. Additionally, the preference for the rank-order-centroid method over the rank-sum method further enriches the understanding of attribute weighting techniques. I am eager to delve further into your research to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the implications and applications of these findings in decision-making processes."

Results support the translation of these effects: participants primed with Apple logos behave more creatively than IBM primed and controls; Disney-primed participants behave more honestly than E!-primed participants and controls. Second, this article investigates the hypothesis that exposure to goal-relevant brands (i.e., those that represent a positively valenced characteristic) elicits behavior that is goal directed in nature. Three experiments demonstrate that the primed behavior showed typical goal-directed qualities, including increased performance postdelay, decreased performance postprogress, and moderation by motivation."

We find that stocks experiencing unusually high (low) trading volume over a day or a week tend to appreciate (depreciate) over the course of the following month. We argue that this high‐volume return premium is consistent with the idea that shocks in the trading activity of a stock affect its visibility, and in turn the subsequent demand and price for that stock. Return autocorrelations, firm announcements, market risk, and liquidity do not seem to explain our results."

We show that executives reduce the lower bound of the forecast confidence interval during times of high market uncertainty; however, ex post miscalibration is worst during periods of high uncertainty. We also find that executives who are miscalibrated about the stock market show similar miscalibration regarding their own firms’ prospects. Finally, firms with miscalibrated executives seem to follow more aggressive corporate policies: investing more and using more debt financing."

The finding that executives are severely miscalibrated, with realized market returns falling within their 80% confidence intervals only 36% of the time, highlights the extent of their overconfidence. It is especially interesting to observe that executives tend to reduce the lower bound of the forecast confidence interval during periods of high market uncertainty, although their miscalibration remains pronounced during these times. Furthermore, the link between executive miscalibration and similar miscalibration regarding their own firms' prospects, as well as the association with more aggressive corporate policies such as increased investment and higher debt financing, adds depth to the understanding of the impact of executive behavior on firm decision-making.

Using data on all OSRD-funded invention, we show this shock had a formative impact on the US innovation system, catalyzing technology clusters across the country, with accompanying increases in high-tech entrepreneur-ship and employment. These effects persist until at least the 1970s and appear to be driven by agglomerative forces and endogenous growth. In addition to creating technology clusters, wartime R&D permanently changed the trajectory of overall US innovation in the direction of OSRD-funded technologies."
