      "content": "Story prompt: Alex enjoyed writing historical fiction stories and his friend Sharon happened to be one of the greatest experts in topics like human history, cultures, anthropology, etc. One day, Alex said to Sharon that he was writing a new story in which ancient cultures settled and integrated with the indigenous peoples of the Malay archipelago. Alex needed Sharon’s advice on something.\n\n“I’m trying to write about a retaliatory strike against the Yuan Dynasty.”, said Alex.\n\n“I’m hooked. So, how does it go?”, asked Sharon.\n\n“So, for context, after several ancient cultures accidentally landed in the Malay archipelago, there was some cultural integration, assimilation, a few conflicts, but otherwise a positive experience. Then just like in real life, the Mongols attempted to invade Java, but with these ancient cultures and indigenous peoples combined powers, they defeat the Mongol threats and decide to send a message to the Yuan Dynasty.”\n\n“Hanging on to every word here. So who’re the new settlers and previous?”, asked Sharon.\n\n“In order from first to last, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Hindus, Aksumites, Vikings, Anglo-Saxons and Japanese. As for the setting, this chapter takes place after 1293, 1294, after the failed Mongol invasion.”\n\n“Gonna need more info on the previous settlers who’ll be in conflict with the Mongols, Alex.”\n\n“Egyptians settlers were descended from the Eighteenth Dynasty, Persians from the Achaemenid Empire, Greeks from during the time when they were still city-states, Carthaginians from Carthage, obviously, Romans from the Roman Empire, Hindus from Hindu traders and priests, Aksumites from the Kingdom of Aksum, of course, Vikings arrived during the time of the Viking Age, Anglo-Saxons came specifically from the kingdom of Wessex, and the Japanese came from the feudal era of Japan.”\n\n“And the idea is that they, and the many diverse indigenous groups of Austronesian and Melanesian peoples, sail to the mainland and initiate a retaliatory strike at the heart of the Yuan Dynasty?”\n\n“Correct.”\n\n“Question, Alex. In your story, I would assume that each ancient culture shared their weapons, armors and strategies with each other and the indigenous peoples?”\n\n\"Correct, again. Each type of soldier and warrior expected from each of the settler and indigenous peoples I mentioned earlier will be involved. Some will remain the same, like Greek hoplites or Roman legionnaires, Vikings, samurai that were present during this particular setting, and there will be some who combined it because they’re a mix of them, so you’d probably see someone who’s half-Javanese, half-Roman wearing a mix of both cultures’ armor or a part-Mangyan, part-Viking, part-Japanese person using the weapons and armors of those three cultures.”\n“But do they have horses?”, asked Sharon.\n\nAlex replied, “Yeah. The Greeks brought them to the Malay archipelago and so did later cultures.”\n\nSharon was very invested and used her knowledge to help Alex write down his story with any historically accurate details that he’d needed.

Just in time for the next few decades to pass for the arrival of Muslim traders and missionaries, which also happened in real life, but now these Muslims, like the Mongols, would be the next groups to call the Malay archipelago their home.”\n\nSharon continued to help and user her knowledge to help Alex write down more of his story with any historically accurate details that he’d needed.
