      "content": "Certainly! Here's a code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to update image names based on an old and new name mapping:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Dictionary mapping old image names to new names\nimage_mapping = {\n    \"old_image1.jpg\": \"new_image1.jpg\",\n    \"old_image2.jpg\": \"new_image2.jpg\",\n    \"old_image3.jpg\": \"new_image3.jpg\"\n}\n\n# Directory containing the images\nimage_directory = \"./images\"\n\n# Function to update image names based on the mapping\ndef update_image_names():\n    for filename in os.listdir(image_directory):\n        if filename in image_mapping:\n            # Get the old and new names from the mapping\n            old_name = filename\n            new_name = image_mapping[filename]\n\n            # Build the full file paths for the old and new names\n            old_path = os.path.join(image_directory, old_name)\n            new_path = os.path.join(image_directory, new_name)\n\n            # Rename the image file\n            os.rename(old_path, new_path)\n            print(f\"Renamed '{old_name}' to '{new_name}'\")\n\n# Call the function to update image names\nupdate_image_names()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the dictionary `image_mapping` contains the old image names as keys and the corresponding new names as values. The `update_image_names()` function iterates through the files in the specified `image_directory` and checks if the filename exists in the image mapping dictionary. If a match is found, it renames the file by using `os.rename()`.\n\nYou can modify the image mapping and the image directory path to suit your specific scenario. Additionally, make sure to have a backup of your images before running this code to avoid any unintended consequences.\n\nI hope this code snippet helps you update image names based on the old and new name mapping. Let me know if you have any further questions!"
