JuiceSSH - A feature-rich SSH client that allows you to connect to remote servers from your phone.\n\n3. ConnectBot - Another popular SSH client that supports SSH, Telnet, and local shell connections.\n\nCode editors:\n\n1. Visual Studio Code - A popular and powerful code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers support for many programming languages, extensions, and other customization options.\n\n2. Sublime Text - A lightweight and efficient text editor with a clean and minimalistic interface. It also supports many programming languages and plugins.\n\n3. Vim - A highly configurable and versatile text editor with a steep learning curve but powerful features.\n\n4. Emacs - Another popular text editor with many advanced features and customization options, similar to Vim. It has a steeper learning curve than some other editors, but can be very powerful once mastered.\n\nUltimately, the best terminal or code editor for you might depend on your personal preferences, the type of work you're doing, and the features you require. We recommend trying out a few different options and see which ones work best for your needs.",
