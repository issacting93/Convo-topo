      "content": "Mother tongue influence (MTI) can be a significant barrier for individuals attempting to learn a new language, particularly when speaking with native speakers or individuals from different regions. However, there are several training activities that can be implemented to reduce the effects of MTI on language learning. \n\n1. Phonetics Training: One effective training activity is phonetics training. This involves teaching learners the proper use of language sounds, intonation, and stress. By identifying and practicing the correct pronunciation, learners can overcome the influence of their mother tongue.\n\n2. Shadowing: Another useful technique is shadowing. This is the activity of repeating what someone else says immediately after they say it. This practice helps learners improve their pronunciation and intonation while minimizing their MTI.\n\n3. Vocabulary Building Exercises: Building vocabulary in the target language is necessary for breaking away from MTI. Vocabulary-building exercises for learners with MTI should focus on everyday conversation expressions, grammatical structures, and idioms. Learning appropriate vocabulary outside of one’s mother tongue allows proficiency in the target language and reduces the influence of MTI.\n\n4. Cultural Immersion: In cultural immersion, learners engage in native environments and contexts to expose themselves to accents and dialects without their MTI. This practice exploits their brain’s ability to understand and mimic new sounds and expressions.\n\n5. Corrective Feedback: Regular corrective feedback is essential to identify and correct mistakes that arise from MTI. Constructive feedback is crucial for continuous growth and development.\n\nOverall, the process of reducing MTI in language learning can be difficult, but with patience and dedication, learners can make significant progress with targeted training activities.",
