However, it should be noted that exact parallels or direct influence between the two texts have not been definitively established. Here are some key points and viewpoints from scholars:\n\nSupporting the claim:\n- Some scholars argue that the seven-day structure of Genesis 1:1-2:4 can be seen as a deliberate response or contrast to the Enuma Elish's seven generations of gods.\n- They suggest that the emphasis on seven days in Genesis may symbolize the superiority and sovereignty of the Hebrew God over the Enuma Elish's pantheon of gods, culminating in His rest on the seventh day.\n- The parallel between the final generation of gods producing a supreme ruler, Marduk, in Enuma Elish and God establishing Himself as the ultimate ruler in Genesis has been noted by scholars.\n\nChallenging the claim:\n- Other scholars suggest that the seven-day structure in Genesis 1:1-2:4 may have been influenced by other ancient Near Eastern creation narratives or may have been an independent creation motif.\n- They argue that the purpose and theological message of the Enuma Elish and Genesis 1:1-2:4 differ significantly, and any similarities are more likely the result of a shared cultural worldview rather than direct influence.\n- It is important to consider that the Enuma Elish and Genesis were composed in different cultural and historical contexts and were likely intended to convey different theological and cultural messages.\n\nOverall, while some scholars propose a connection between the seven-day structure in Genesis and the seven generations of gods in the Enuma Elish, it remains a debated and complex topic with no clear consensus among experts.",
