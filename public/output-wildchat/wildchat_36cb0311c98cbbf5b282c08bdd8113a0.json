It’ll make our shimmer shine across the galaxy!”\n\nGloopy (pulling off headphones): “Groovy, Glitter! But remember the last time? We ended up as intergalactic disco balls!”\n\nGlitter laughs, her sparkle intensifying.\n\nScene 2: The Space Entry Competition\n\n- The scene transitions to a colorful and dazzling space arena, buzzing with aliens of all shapes and sizes.\n- A banner reads, “The Great Space Entry – Dazzle the Judges for a Galactic Prize!”\n\nGloopy: “I hear this year’s prize is a warp drive that could power our blob-mobile for light years!”\n\nGlitter: “Ooh, Gloopy, let’s win this! I’ve got just the thing!”\n\nScene 3: Preparation\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter are backstage, prepping for their entry.\n- Gloopy stretches into funny shapes while Glitter applies her Sparkle-Boost Serum.\n\nGlitter: “Time to shine!” (She dabs the serum on both, causing them to glitter spectacularly.)\n\nGloopy: “We’ll be the brightest blobs this side of the Milky Way!”\n\nScene 4: The Performance\n\n- The competition begins, and various alien acts display their talents.\n- Gloopy and Glitter slide onto the stage, leaving a shimmering trail.\n\nAnnouncer: “Here come Gloopy and Glitter, the Glowing Wonders of Gloopiter!”\n\n- The duo performs a shining acrobatic routine, bouncing and blending into dazzling shapes, radiating light that forms constellations.\n- The audience is awestruck as Gloopy and Glitter create a nebula of vibrant colors, culminating in a grand finale that illuminates the entire arena.\n\nScene 5: Victory and Surprise\n\n- Applause erupts. Gloopy and Glitter are handed the warp drive.\n- As they celebrate, Gloopy nudges Glitter.\n\nGloopy: “Hey, Glitter, check it out!”\n\n- He points to a pair of starry-eyed alien kids who are playing, imitating Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering forms with wonder and delight.\n\nGlitter (teary-eyed): “We’re not just shining stars, Gloopy. We’re role models!”\n\nGloopy: “Bright blobs for a bright future, Glitter!”\n\nScene 6: A Sparkling Conclusion\n\n- The episode closes with Gloopy and Glitter driving off in their now warp-drive-powered blob-mobile.\n- They zipline through space, leaving a shimmery streak across the stars.\n\nVoiceover: “And so, Gloopy and Glitter zoom off to new adventures, spreading their sparkle far and wide, promising to return with more tales from the cosmos!”\n\n- The screen fades to black as we hear the echoing giggles of Gloopy and Glitter, with the twinkle of interstellar glitter in the background.\n\nTitle: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”\n\nEpisode: “A Touch of Slime”\n\nScene 1: The Wondrous World of Wobbleonia\n\n- As the sun rises over the slime-covered mountains of Wobbleonia, we see Gloopy and Glitter in their blob-mobile traversing the starlit cosmos.\n- Suddenly, the blob-mobile jolts, causing them to make an unexpected landing on a planet blanketed in shades of pink.\n\nGloopy: “Whoa, Glitter! This place is like a cotton candy dream!”\n\nGlitter: “Look at the shimmering pink sands, Gloopy. It’s so… sparkly!”\n\nScene 2: The Pink Encounter\n\n- While exploring, they meet a friendly pink alien named Blibby, who sports big curious eyes and a gentle smile.\n- Blibby is fascinated by Gloopy and Glitter’s shiny appearance and is eager to make new friends.\n\nBlibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!”\n\nGlitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy. Our ship had a bit of a hiccough.”\n\nScene 3: The Curious Touch\n\n- Blibby is both awed and intrigued by Gloopy and Glitter’s shimmering skin.\n- With a polite request, Blibby reaches out to touch Gloopy, wondering if the shine is a solid shell.\n\nBlibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!”\n\nGloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!”\n\n- When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement.\n\nBlibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky! What a marvelous sensation!”\n\nScene 4: The Slime Session\n\n- Gloopy laughs and jiggles, while Glitter uses her sparkles to clean up the goo from Blibby’s hand, leaving a twinkle on her skin.\n- Overcoming the initial shock, Blibby is now brimming with excitement and requests a lesson in slime play from Gloopy and Glitter.\n\nGlitter: “Let’s give Blibby the ultimate slime experience! Ready to get your hands goopy?”\n\nBlibby: “Yes, please! Teach me your slimy ways!”\n\nScene 5: Slimey Shenanigans\n\n- Gloopy shows Blibby how to bounce and mold the slime into different shapes, sparking joy and laughter.\n- Glitter teaches Blibby how to make sparkly goo, combining their textures into a dazzling visual display.\n\nBlibby (with glee): “This is incredible! Our people love new forms of art. With your slime, the possibilities are endless!”\n\nGloopy: “Sharing our slime is our pleasure, Blibby!”\n\nScene 6: An Artsy Farewell\n\n- As the day ends, they invite Blibby to share this newfound art with the rest of Rosalux.\n- The pink world soon becomes a canvas of colorful slime sculptures and glittery designs, thanks to their collaborative effort.\n\nGlitter: “You’re a natural, Blibby! Rosalux looks even more stunning now!”\n\nBlibby: “Thank you, Gloopy and Glitter. We’ll treasure this slimy, sparkly art forever!”\n\nScene 7: Departure to Dazzle Another Day\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to their new friend and her pink planet as they board their repaired blob-mobile.\n- They set off into the cosmos, eager for the next whimsical adventure, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and slime-art on Rosalux.\n\nVoiceover: “And so, Gloopy and Glitter continue their journey across the stars, spreading creativity and joy in the slimiest of ways!”\n\n- As the blob-mobile zooms away, the camera pans to show the glowing pink planet, now adorned with slime sculptures shimmering under the starlight.\nWrite character descriptions about the 2, their appearance, personality and abilitieas\nCharacter: Gloopy\n\nAppearance:\n- Gloopy is a laid-back teal blob with a semi-translucent body that exudes a gentle glow.\n- His eyes are two small floating orbs within his gelatinous form, exuding warmth and friendliness with every blink.\n- A charming smile is often etched near what would conventionally be the front of his blobby body.\n- Whenever Gloopy moves, his body wobbles and reshapes, showing his flexible and adaptable nature visually.\n\nPersonality:\n- The essence of chill, Gloopy is the kind of blob that takes life at a relaxed pace, believing in going with the flow.\n- He’s got a sunny disposition, is never in a hurry, and loves to soak up the cosmic tunes with his entire being.\n- A great listener, Gloopy is supportive and often serves as the voice of reason in his adventures with Glitter.\n- His open-mindedness and creativity make him a hit in the artsy circles of the galaxy and an endearing figure to friends.\n\nAbilities:\n- Gloopy’s malleable form allows him to stretch, squish, and reshape himself into a variety of configurations, from thin pancake-like extensions to bouncy spheres.\n- He can absorb certain impacts like a jelly, which also helps him get out of sticky situations, both figuratively and literally.\n- Gloopy has a unique talent for creating and controlling sound waves with his slimy vibrations, using them to communicate or to soothe friends with his space-themed tunes.\n\nCharacter: Glitter\n\nAppearance:\n- Glitter is a sparkling fuchsia blob with a brighter and more solid appearance than Gloopy, emitting a constant stream of fine glitter that leaves trails wherever she goes.\n- Like Gloopy, her eyes are floating sparkly specks that always seem to be twinkling with excitement.\n- Her smile gleams brightly, often punctuated by bursts of shimmer when she’s particularly joyful or enthusiastic.\n\nPersonality:\n- Full of vim and vigor, Glitter is the dynamo of the duo, always eager to embark on new adventures and concoct new experiments in their bubbling lab.\n- A fountain of ideas and initiatives, she’s the driving force behind their escapades, often sparking action with her sparkly personality.\n- Resourceful and inventive, Glitter often combines her love for all things shiny with practical solutions, though her enthusiasm can occasionally lead to dazzlingly unpredictable consequences.\n\nAbilities:\n- Glitter’s body is infused with a mysterious sparkle dust, which she can control and manipulate to create awe-inspiring light shows or to enhance their visibility in various performances.\n- She has a unique ability to concoct various potions and serums, many of which have glittery effects that can be both beneficial and mesmerizing.\n- Her sparkles have a subtle, magical quality, capable of cleaning, repairing, or creating things, making her a handy blob to have around in a crisis or for a touch of pizzazz.\n\nTogether, Gloopy and Glitter are an unstoppable team, complementing each other’s abilities and personalities as they embark on intergalactic adventures, spreading good vibes and glitter dust across the cosmos.\n\nTitle: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”\n\nEpisode: “The Barren Planet of Shadows”\n\nScene 1: Lost in the Cosmos\n\n- The blob-mobile zips across the cosmos, its warp drive allowing Gloopy and Glitter to push the boundaries of their explorations like never before.\n- Suddenly, the warp drive sputters, and alarms blare. They’re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet.\n\nGloopy: “Whoa, the warp drive is acting up. We’re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!”\n\nGlitter: “Hang on, Gloopy! Let’s make this an opportunity to discover something new!”\n\n- The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light.\n\nScene 2: The Mysterious Terrain\n\n- Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks.\n- The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows.\n\nGloopy: “This place could use some of our sparkly charm, don’t you think?”\n\nGlitter: “Definitely. It’s so… drab.”\n\nScene 3: The Shadow Stir\n\n- As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy’s gooey footprints and Glitter’s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world.\n- Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It’s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light.\n\nGlitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): “Do you see that, Gloopy? The shadows are moving!”\n\nGloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!”\n\nScene 4: The Connection\n\n- As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them.\n- This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication.\n\nGlitter (excitedly): “Gloopy, they’re smart! Let’s see if we can understand them.”\n\nScene 5: Learning and Teaching\n\n- Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses.\n- After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another.\n\nGloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.”\n\nGlitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!”\n\nScene 6: Cooperation\n\n- With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet.\n- The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop.\n\nGloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!”\n\nGlitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!”\n\nScene 7: The Transformation\n\n- As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo.\n- Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color.\n\nGlitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!”\n\nScene 8: A World Reborn\n\n- The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice.\n- The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see.\n\nGloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.”\n\nGlitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.”\n\nScene 9: Farewell and Forward\n\n- With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye.\n- The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness.\n\nVoiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.”\n\n- The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles.\n\nTHE END\nWrite a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown\nForum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?”\n\nUser1: CosmicFan88\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM\n\nHey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts?\n\nUser2: SparkleQueen101\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM\n\nI’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good.\n\nUser3: ToonTracker67\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM\n\nNot to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule.\n\nUser4: SpaceJelly\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM\n\nI heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞\n\nUser5: XiaolinDragon\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM\n\nUser4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic!\n\nUser6: WebHead93\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM\n\nHonestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’.\n\nModerator: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM\n\nReminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in.\n\nUser7: GloopTroop\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM\n\n‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December.\n\nUser8: StarlightShimmer\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM\n\nI’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks!\n\nUser9: TheAnimatedFan\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM\n\nThis isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned!\n\nUser1: CosmicFan88\nPosted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM\n\nAppreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨\n\nModerator: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM\n\nJust a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos.\n\nUser2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him.\n\nUser3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later.\n\nAnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those!\n\nToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW.\n\nUser1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover?\n\n90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds.\n\nMangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series.\n\nDigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up.\n\nSaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes.\n\nUser4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that?\n\nTVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions.\n\nUser5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing!\n\nUser2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it?\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nAbsolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nAnd speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good.\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nI’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\n@ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\nNew shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\n@RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nFingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nWell said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup!\nWrite a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nOh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nRelieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nAgreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like!\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nLate March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nI gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\nMost definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch!\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nA marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nLove the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates!\nWrite a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nBreaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March.\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nYes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nMeanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”?\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\n@Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate?\n\nUser 6 (RetroTooner):\n“Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block.\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nWhile it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nI’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too!\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nIt’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites!\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nChanges or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure.\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nCouldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone!\nWrite a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nTime for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.”\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nWhaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nI bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nI’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nReplacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nNo more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.”\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\n“Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nYou’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHeads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running.\n\nUser 11 (WebWizard):\nOh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era!\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nHey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nYay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\n@4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition.\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nStreaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned!\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nAwesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though.\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nWho knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nSounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong!\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nOh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nDefinitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness!\n\nUser 12 (4KidsMod):\nCouldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nWhew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final!\n\nUser 13 (LyokoFanatic):\nTotally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nBig day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, \n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nThose show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.'\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nHey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nAbsolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment!\n\nUser 14 (NewToonWatcher):\nJust started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on?\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\nYep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up!\n\nUser 8 (ComicBookJones):\nKudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends.\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nAs someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us.\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nHey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good!\n\nUser 15 (MultiverseMarvel):\n“Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book!\n\nUser 9 (KirbyStarWarrior):\nTotally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves.\n\nUser 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia):\n“The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe?\n\nUser 4 (TheCartoonCritic):\nAmazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic.\n\nUser 7 (DigitalPokeFan003):\nWhoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome.\n\nUser 16 (TooniverseTrekker):\nDid NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing.\n\nUser 2 (Anime_Avenger):\nA bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better!\n\nUser 10 (CartoonConnoisseur):\nBetween a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling.\n\nUser 5 (ToonSquadMember):\nI’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself!\n\nUser 1 (Club Toon Moderator):\nThe next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

It’s a total overhaul!

While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network.\n\nFor starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series.\n\nOn the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance.\n\nThere were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy.\n\nHowever, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows.\n\nThe stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution.\nWrite a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue\nAdored By The Network / Western Animation\n\nWhile many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network.\n\nInitially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp.\n\nThis decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel.\n\nIn discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions.\n\n“GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success.\n\nThese instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come.\n\nForum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?”\n\nUser1: TooniverseTim\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM\n\nHey fellow animation aficionados!

What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes?\n\nUser2: CartoonCatcher\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM\n\nOh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule:\n\n07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball\n07:30 Teen Titans Go!\n08:00 Craig of the Creek\n08:30 Xiaolin Showdown\n09:00 Code Lyoko\n09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated\n10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold\n10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\n11:00 Johnny Test\n11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man\n\nSome solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM\n\nI’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on!\n\nUser4: NostalgiaNerd\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM\n\nMid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there.\n\nUser5: WBAnimationFan\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM\n\nTrue, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”?\n\nModerator: KidsWB_Mod\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM\n\nEvening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions!\n\nUser6: SaturdayMornLover\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM\n\nIt’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic!\n\nUser7: ToonTalker\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM\n\nI think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine!\n\nUser1: TooniverseTim\nPosted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM\n\nGreat points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB!

The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts?\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM\n\nI’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish?\n\nUser3: ClassicToonGal\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM\n\nChange is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us!\n\nUser4: AnimationAdmirer\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM\n\nIt’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least.\n\nUser5: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\nGotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans.\n\nModerator: WBToonMod\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM\n\nEveryone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes!\n\nUser6: NostalgicNick\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM\n\nIt’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those.\n\nUser7: RetroRanger\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM\n\n2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for!\n\nUser8: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM\n\nJust when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring?\n\nUser9: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM\n\nI’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next.\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM\n\nAll we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress!\n\nForum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes”\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM\n\nThe news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.”\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM\n\nCW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup.\n\nUser3: 4KidsFaithful\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM\n\nWow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can!\n\nUser4: ScoobySquadMember\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM\n\nAs a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.”\n\nUser5: NewEraToonFan\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM\n\nSo it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through!\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM\n\nJust a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone!\n\nUser6: AnimationAdmirer\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM\n\nSo “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”!\n\nUser7: RetroRanger\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nSeems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners.\n\nUser8: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM\n\nMixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion.\n\nUser9: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM\n\nRegardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids!\n\nUser1: ToonTalkerTim\nPosted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM\n\nAbsolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms.

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update?\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM\n\nInteresting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics!\n\nUser3: 4KidsFaithful\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM\n\nGotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄\n\nUser4: ScoobySquadMember\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM\n\nLoved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool.\n\nUser5: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM\n\nI’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance!\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM\n\nLet’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids!\n\nUser6: NostalgicNick\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM\n\nChange is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm.

Pokémon is always a win, in my book!\n\nUser7: RetroRanger\nPosted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM\n\nBoth “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better.

With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised?\n\nUser2: VintageToonLover\nPosted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM\n\nHonestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know?\n\nUser3: LyokoChampion\nPosted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM\n\nAbsolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion.

The story arcs this season are top-notch!\n\nUser4: AnimationAce\nPosted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM\n\nI’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot.

But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked.\n\nUser5: ToonTracker\nPosted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM\n\n“Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi!

The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers.\n\nModerator: KidsWBModerator\nPosted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM\n\nGreat to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted.

September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this?\n\nUser2: VintageToonLover\nPosted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM\n\nStoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true.\n\nUser3: LyokoChampion\nPosted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM\n\nYeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko.

Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype.\n\nUser4: AnimationAce\nPosted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM\n\nThe premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book.

It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new.\n\nUser7: ScoobyGangMember\nPosted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM\n\nNever understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm.

Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience.\n\nAs we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements.\n\nDuring this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April.\n\nThe following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction:\n\n- “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup.\n- “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures.\n- “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers.\n\nAdditionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast.\n\nPlease rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate.\n\nAs we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends.\n\nWe look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nDirector of Programming Strategy\n4Kids Entertainment\nWrite a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship\n4Kids Entertainment\nDecember 15, 2023\n\nThe CW Television Network\n3300 W Olive Ave,\nBurbank, CA 91505\n\nAttention: CW Programming Department\n\nRe: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series\n\nDear CW Executives,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch.\n\nHaving carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks.

Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM\n\nI noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars?\n\nUser4: 90sCartoonKid\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM\n\nGames on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before.\n\nUser5: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nDefinitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows!\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nGlad to see the community buzzing about the new website features!

But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong.\n\nUser7: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM\n\nThis is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out.

As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM\n\nHonestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM\n\nThis is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor.\n\nUser4: 90sCartoonKid\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM\n\nGotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years.\n\nUser5: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM\n\nIt’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own.\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM\n\nWhile we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together!\n\nUser6: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nTransitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids!\n\nUser7: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nMy Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out.

Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM\n\nHeard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM\n\nYep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too.\n\nUser4: VoxPopuli\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM\n\nChange can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too.\n\nUser5: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nChange is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty.\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM\n\nLet’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments!\n\nUser6: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nThat Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too!\n\nUser7: AnimationIsLife\nPosted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM\n\nListeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in!

There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased:\n\n- “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series!\n- “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup.\n- “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love.\n- “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist.\n- “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles.\n- “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever.\n- “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests.\n- “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM\n\nSeen it, and I’m hyped!

Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though.\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM\n\nLots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive.

It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon?\n\nUser2: DigitalDrew92\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM\n\nAbsolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRewind\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM\n\nMakes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’\n\nUser4: 90sCartoonKid\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\n“Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows.\n\nUser5: AnimationAce\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM\n\nNot gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy.\n\nModerator: CWtoonMod\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nYou’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve!\n\nUser6: SaturdayMorningMaster\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM\n\nNever doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding.\n\nUser7: TheToonFanatic\nPosted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM\n\nYou can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though?\n\nUser2: RetroRobloxian\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM\n\nI’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings.\n\nUser3: DigitalStreamer\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM\n\nHonestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows.\n\nUser4: AnimationAdvocate\nPosted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM\n\nThe Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad.

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful!\n\nUser2: Anime_Avenger\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM\n\nTotally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today.\n\nUser3: ToonHero93\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nBig fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you.\n\nUser4: PokeMasterAsh\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM\n\n“Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe!\n\nUser5: SaturdayToonsRule\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM\n\nNot gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons.\n\nUser6: RetroKid\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM\n\nI was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on!\n\nModerator: CW4Kids_Mod\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM\n\nLoving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else!\n\nUser7: CartoonFanForever\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM\n\nHave to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best!\n\nUser8: ToonSpectrum\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM\n\n“GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time!\n\nUser9: ComicsAndToons\nPosted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM\n\nThe line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!\nWrite a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has\nForum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!”\n\nUser1: ToonTasticTom\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM\n\nHey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it?\n\nUser2: BumperCollector\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM\n\nCaught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new.\n\nUser3: SaturdayToonWatcher\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM\n\nYeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward.\n\nUser4: RetroToonFan\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM\n\nIt’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.”\n\nUser5: AnimationAce\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM\n\nCertainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm.\n\nModerator: CW4Kids_Mod\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM\n\nWe’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks!\n\nUser6: SonicSpeedster\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nThe bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho!\n\nUser7: CartoonCraze\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM\n\nWas pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next!\n\nUser8: ToonFrenzy\nPosted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM\n\nAbsolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat.\n\nUser2: SaturdayMornHistorian\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM\n\nDefinitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign.\n\nUser3: ToonTracker101\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM\n\nIt’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother.\n\nUser4: WBtoonFan\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM\n\nI’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table.\n\nUser5: RetroToonster\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM\n\nThis name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming.\n\nUser6: TooniverseSleuth\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM\n\nSo I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming.\n\nUser7: NewEraToonGoer\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM\n\n“GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably.\n\nUser1: AnimationInsider\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM\n\nInteresting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings!\n\nUser8: DigitalToonExplorer\nPosted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM\n\nNostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments.

That would be sick!\n\nUser3: RetroQuester\nPosted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM\n\nRight? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon.

CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era?\n\nUser2: RetroRevivalRandy\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM\n\nHonestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup.\n\nUser3: SaturdayMorningMaven\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM\n\nI’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April.\n\nUser4: AnimationAficionado\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM\n\nAs nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path.\n\nUser5: TooniverseExplorer\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM\n\nCan’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples.

Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us!\n\nUser6: DigitalToonFan\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM\n\nI’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts?\n\nUser2: SaturdayMorningSavant\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM\n\nThe transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.”\n\nUser3: RetroCartoonRanger\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM\n\nIt’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with.\n\nUser4: 90sToonsForever\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM\n\nAs much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way!\n\nUser5: NostalgiaNerd92\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM\n\nThis is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great.\n\nUser6: ModernToonMage\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM\n\n4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement.\n\nUser7: TooniverseExplorer\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM\n\nI’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride!\n\nUser8: DigitalToonAdventurer\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM\n\nThese changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows!\n\nModerator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM\n\nThe lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday!\nWrite a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1\nForum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New”\n\nUser1: TooniverseTrekker\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM\n\nIt’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother.\n\nNow, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it?\n\nUser2: RetroRebootFan\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM\n\nThat’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans.\n\nUser3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM\n\nAgreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane!\n\nUser4: AnimationAnalyst\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM\n\nMakes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context.\n\nUser5: ModernToonMage\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM\n\nI’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation!\n\nModerator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM\n\nThe decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time!\nWrite a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted\nForum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids”\n\nUser1: SaturdayNostalgia\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM\n\nIt’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive.\n\nUser2: ToonFan4Ever\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM\n\nSo true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times.\n\nUser3: RetroToonRevivalist\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM\n\nIt’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven!\n\nUser4: DigitalToonDiver\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM\n\nTheir consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage!\n\nModerator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM\n\nAs we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure!\n\nUser5: AnimationAppreciator\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM\n\nIt’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier!\n\nUser6: ToonLegacyLover\nPosted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM\n\nSeeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic.

It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing \"Cyber Soldier Porygon\" from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights?\n\nUser4: PokeManiac\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM\n\nYeah, \"Cyber Soldier Porygon\" is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I'm guessing they've got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans.\n\nUser5: NostalgiaNerd\nPosted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM\n\nThe evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows.
