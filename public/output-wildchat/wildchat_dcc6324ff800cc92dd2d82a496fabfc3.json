      "content": "The effective interest rate takes into account the effect of compounding on the nominal interest rate. To calculate the effective interest rate, we use the formula:\n\nEffective interest rate = (1 + (nominal interest rate / n))^n - 1\n\nwhere n is the number of compounding periods in a year (in this case, 4 for quarterly compounding).\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nEffective interest rate = (1 + (0.15 / 4))^4 - 1\nEffective interest rate = 0.1585 or 15.85%\n\nTherefore, the effective interest rate per year for a nominal interest rate of 15% per year compounded quarterly is 15.85%."

In this case, m is 12 since the interest is compounded monthly.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\nNominal rate = ([(1 + 0.08/12) ^ 12] - 1) * 100%\nNominal rate = ([(1.0067) ^ 12] - 1) * 100%\nNominal rate = 0.0983 or 9.83%\n\nTherefore, the nominal interest rate per year compounded monthly that is equivalent to an effective annual interest rate of 8% is 9.83%."
