After the initial proceedings, they break into smaller groups, engaging in banter and scheming.**\n\n**Russian Supervillain (Ruslan the Ruthless):** \"Comrades, welcome to the Samite. Before we plot to overthrow the world, shall we first decide who makes the strongest vodka?\" *\u043d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e, \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0437\u044c\u044f?

(Now let's party!)*\n\n**Polish Supervillain (Karol the Crafty):** \"Hah, spirit talks? My friends, you haven't lived until you've had a night with our \u015bliwowica. It's like getting punched by a superpowered fist.\"\n\n**Czech Supervillain (Viktor the Venomous):** \"You all make strong cases, but ever heard of our absinthe? One sip, and you'll be seeing doubles\u2014doubling your chances for evil, that is.\" *to je ono!

(Great, isn't it?)*\n\n**Serbian Supervillain (Nikola the Nefarious):** \"Borovi\u010dka, absinthe... playthings! Rakija is the true elixir of malevolence. It inspires the diabolic plans.\" *za zlo! (To evil!)*\n\n**Croatian Supervillain (Luka the Lurid):** \"Please, rakija is as common as daylight in the Balkans. But our orahovica, now that's the real conspirator's companion.\" \n\n**Bulgarian Supervillain (Boris the Brutal):** \"All of these spirits, and yet none have the magic of our mastika. It's like drinking the very essence of Balkan mischief.\" *\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435! (Cheers!)*\n\n**Slovene Supervillain (Milo\u0161 the Malevolent):** \"Mischief? My dear Boris, our \u017eganje ignites the flame of chaos with just a whisper of its name.\" *vino gre do srca. (Wine goes to the heart.)*\n\n**Macedonian Supervillain (Aleksandar the Awful):** \"Whispers? Flames?

(To health!)*\n\n**Montenegrin Supervillain (Vladimir the Vile):** \"Accomplices, drinks... rakija unites us, but have you tasted the black magic of our loza? It's as dark as our deeds.\"\n\n**Suddenly, amidst their boisterous debates over spirits, an eerie silence falls over the group.**\n\n**Ruslan the Ruthless:** \"Well, well, well. It seems we all can agree on one thing\u2014our spirits are as strong and varied as our plans for villainy. Now, to the more pressing matter at hand\u2014world domination.\"\n\n**Olena the Ominous:** \"Indeed. But first, let's raise a glass\u2014of whatever poison you prefer\u2014to our unity in evil! May the world tremble before the might of the Slavic supervillains!\"\n\n**All laugh menacingly, each raising a glass filled with their national spirit, their cultural differences uniting them in their common goal.**\n\n**As the laughter echoes through the castle halls, the Samite of Slavic Evil finds common ground, not just in their nefarious goals, but in the proud traditions and spirits of their homelands. Little did the world know, the greatest threat wasn't their individual plans for domination, but their unity in mischief and mayhem.**\n\n**And so, the night went on, filled with plotting, planning, and a never-ending supply of spirits, the true fuel for their malevolent machinery. But that, my friends, is a tale for another night.**",

And it is worth choosing which language to choose as the official language of the summit: Church Slavonic Church Slavonic,[a] also known as Church Slavic,[2] New Church Slavonic, New Church Slavic or just Slavonic (as it was called by its native speakers), is the conservative Slavic liturgical language used by the Eastern Orthodox Church in Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia. The language appears also in the services of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, and occasionally in the services of the Orthodox Church in America.) or Interslavic (Interslavic (Med\u017euslovjansky / \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0436\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044b) is a pan-Slavic auxiliary language. Its purpose is to facilitate communication between speakers of various Slavic languages, as well as to allow people who do not speak a Slavic language to communicate with Slavic speakers by being mutually intelligible with most, if not all, Slavic languages. For Slavs and non-Slavs, it can be used for educational purposes as well).",
