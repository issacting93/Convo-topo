      "content": "Shukuru Town is a charming little town surrounded by charming little hills and fields, only a few miles away from the much more densely-packed Sanrio City. Among the usual buildings within this shining town sits a tiny, yet very popular establishment, one that draws in visitors from miles around and is practically Shukuru's landmark: a wondrous little cafe named Cafe Cinnamon. Cafe Cinnamon is nestled in the heart of this bustling town, known for its fragrant smells, delicious treats, and most importantly; the folks who run the place. This cafe wasn't run by just anyone; instead, it was upheld by six tiny puppies, just as joyful and adorable as they were itty-bitty, that loved each other just as much as they loved their customers! It's because of the presence of these wondrous pups that Cafe Cinnamon is as popular and widely-known as it is, but their charm doesn't end at just their cute appearances and lively personalities. An unusual craze has recently swept through the country and Shukuru Town, and that's the act of wearing diapers! And not just tiny, ordinary diapers; huge, thick, bulky diapers! Every shop was stocked full of them and everyone wore one, and waddling instead of walking and emanating crinkling noises everywhere one went became ordinary! And it was more than just an adorable fashion statement; they were practical too, a wearable, portable means of relieving full tummies and bladders of their burdens by letting it out into the diaper's absorbent cotton instead, before changing out of their full, heavy, smushy diaper and changing into another layer, fresh and dry. The sound of a gurgling, upset tummy is always a sign that someone is about to have an imminent accident!\nOf course, the puppies of Cafe Cinnamon are just the same, always wearing diapers the size and softness of pillows, and have worn them for so long that their frequent accidents are seen as perfectly usual and even quite endearing, sometimes going entirely unnoticed until they're too packed with their own poopies to ignore. The sounds of their rumbling tummies, their grunting exertions bringing forth their accidents (\"N-NNNNF~!\", \"NNNGH!\"), the noisy sounds of their huge messes (*FLBORRRRMPHT!*, *BLARRRRRMP!*, *BLORRRTCH!*), and the smushy wubbling-wobbling noises of their diapers are nearly ambient noise for the cafe, they're so constant and ever-present; to see any of the pups keep a diaper clean for more than a few moments is considered a rarity as of recent times thanks to the almost nonstop rate at which they poop in their diapers!\nCinnamoroll is the most well-known of the pups, being the poster puppy for his cafe; an endlessly hospitable, loving and pure-hearted white puppy with big blue eyes, big ears and a curled tail, he can fly and glide by flapping his ears, though his bulky diapers often keep him grounded. A bit shy at first, but will quickly warm up to anyone with his child-like curiosity and caring instinct shining through, always serving his customers with a warm smile and a wagging tail. He and Cappuccino are particularly close, often eating and napping together and mutually changing each other's full diapers.\nCappuccino is an incredibly gluttonous and laid-back beige puppy, recognizable from his white mullet and particularly rotund tummy. Because of his constant snacking and near-bottomless stomach, his loads are enormous and frequent, and he often poops himself in his sleep during his routinely naps. He prefers to put another diaper layer over his full one instead of changing out of it due to his laziness, and only ever decides to change when it's obvious the diaper he's wearing can't be filled any further. He has daily diaper-filling contests with Cinnamoroll, though Cappuccino always wins effortlessly and by an overwhelming landslide. Only ludicrously large, XXL-sized diapers with incredible capacities can accommodate for his gargantuan loads, those capable of containing nearly a dozen tonnes, and usually needs his friends' helping paws to assist changing him both into and out of such ridiculously vast diapers.\nMocha is the girly-girl and 'big sister' of the group, contrasting Chiffon's sportiness. A silky brown puppy with pink flowers at the base of her ears, she's a stylish, fashion-loving chatterbox and only sees diapers and wearing them as such, a fashion statement, often pairing them with her elegant dresses and outright refuses to poop in any of hers... though just like the other pups, she inevitably does, after which she will immediately go out of her way to change into a clean one. She crafts and wears her own custom-made diapers with exquisite prints and pleasant fragrances built-in.\nChiffon is the tomboy of the bunch, contrasting Mocha's girliness. A light orange puppy with thick, fluffy ears and tail, she's immensely spunky, sporty and exuberant, often spending an entire morning and afternoon running around or playing sports outdoors, and wears diapers as a means of relieving herself in the middle of her athletics instead of wasting time and energy finding the nearest bathroom, oftentimes becoming so engaged with a strenuous activity she's doing she doesn't notice her diaper is totally loaded until after she's done. She wears heavy-duty, multi-layered compact diapers, able to be worn for hours, and filled to capacity, without sagging in the slightest!\nEspresso is a cream-colored puppy with curled ears, the most intelligent of the pups, being well-bred and mild-mannered. A clever mind and a modest gentleman at heart, he is a natural expert at a variety of things, including dancing, painting and music, and is extensively knowledgeable on everything to do with diapers, from their varying sizes and respective capacities, as well as the best brands of diapers for any occasion and where to find them, as well as being an excellent and charismatic diaper changer and barista. He infrequently poops in his diapers, and will gladly keep a full one on for a while, even an entire afternoon, before changing himself, to ensure he doesn't go through too many too quickly.\nMilk is the baby of the group. A teeny-tiny white pup, he's quite spoiled by the other pups and is never seen without his favorite blue pacifier in his mouth. True to his name, he loves drinking milk in huge amounts, his tummy often ballooning with how much and how frequently he drinks. Due to being an infant, he wets his diapers near constantly and can only crawl and babble the phrase \"Ba-boo\". Mocha is usually the one to change him out of his soaked diapers."

      "content": "You decide to help Milk with his soaked diaper. The tiny white pup looks at you with big, innocent eyes as he crawls around the cafe floor, his blue pacifier bobbing in his mouth. You can tell from the sagging diaper that it's time for a change.\n\nMocha, who usually takes care of Milk's diaper changes, is busy attending to customers. She notices your intention to help and gives you a grateful nod. You gather the necessary supplies: a fresh, clean diaper, baby wipes, and some baby powder.\n\nYou gently pick up Milk and lay him down on a soft, clean surface. The pup gazes up at you with trusting eyes as you carefully unfasten his soaked diaper. After disposing of the wet diaper, you use the baby wipes to clean Milk's bottom, making sure he's dry and clean before sprinkling some baby powder.\n\nWith a fresh diaper in hand, you carefully secure it around Milk's tiny waist, making sure it's snug but not too tight. The pup looks comfortable and happy in his new diaper, and he gives you a contented coo as you lift him up.\n\nMocha comes over to thank you, her tail wagging appreciatively. \"You did a great job! Milk seems really comfortable now. Thank you so much for helping out!\"\n\nWhat would you like to do next?\n\n1. Order a drink and a treat from Cinnamoroll.\n2.
