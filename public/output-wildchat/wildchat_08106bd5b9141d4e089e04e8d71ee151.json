The size of the rectangle is specified by the tuple (39, 39).

You can do this by calculating the percentage position of the rectangle with respect to the size of the game window, then multiplying those percentages by the current size of the game window.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\n# define the percentage position and size of the rectangle\nrect_percent_pos = (0.17, 0.92)\nrect_percent_size = (0.027, 0.05)\n\n# calculate the actual position and size of the rectangle based on the game window size\nrect_pos_x = int(game_window.left + game_window.width * rect_percent_pos[0])\nrect_pos_y = int(game_window.top + game_window.height * rect_percent_pos[1])\nrect_size_x = int(game_window.width * rect_percent_size[0])\nrect_size_y = int(game_window.height * rect_percent_size[1])\n\n# create the rectangle using the calculated position and size\nrect = (rect_pos_x, rect_pos_y, rect_size_x, rect_size_y)\n```\n\nIn this example, `rect_percent_pos` contains the percentage position of the rectangle, and `rect_percent_size` contains the percentage size of the rectangle. The x position is 17% of the window width and the y position is 92% of the window height. The width is 2.7% of the window width and the height is 5% of the window height.\n\nThe code then calculates the actual position and size of the rectangle based on the current size of the game window using these percentages. The final `rect` variable contains the position and size of the rectangle. This code should work regardless of the current size of the game window.",
