The composition of two functions that are not bijective can sometimes result in a bijective function, although this is typically not the case.\n\nTo understand why, let's review the definitions:\n\n- A function f is **injective** (or one-to-one) if f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f.\n- A function f is **surjective** (or onto) if for every y in the codomain, there is at least one x in the domain such that f(x) = y.\n- A function is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.\n\nFor the composition g∘f to be bijective, it must be both injective and surjective. It is possible, under certain conditions, for the composition to be bijective even if neither f nor g is bijective. Here are some scenarios:\n\n1. **Injectivity**: If the range of f is a subset of the domain of g where g behaves injectively (even if g is not injective on its whole domain), then g∘f can be injective.\n\n2. **Surjectivity**: If g is surjective onto the range of f (even if f is not surjective), the composition g∘f can be surjective.\n\nTo understand this better, consider an example with three sets A, B, and C, and functions f: A → B and g: B → C.\n\nLet's say f is surjective but not injective (so there is more than one element in A pointing to any given element in B), and g is injective but not surjective (so elements in C may have no pre-images in B). If the range of f completely covers the domain of g where g is injective, and g maps this range onto the entirety of C, then g∘f could be bijective.\n\nHowever, in general, if both f and g are not injective, or both are not surjective, the composition g∘f will usually inherit these restrictions and also not be bijective. Each case depends on the specific properties of f and g and how they interact when composed.",

Let's look at a concrete counterexample where both f and g are not bijective, but their composition g∘f is bijective.\n\nLet's consider the sets A = {1,2}, B = {3,4,5}, and C = {6,7}. Now, define the functions f: A → B and g: B → C as follows:\n\nf(1) = 3\nf(2) = 4\n\ng(3) = 6\ng(4) = 7\ng(5) = 6 (or anything else, since g(5) is irrelevant to our composition)\n\nNow, analyze the bijectiveness of each function:\n\n1. **Function f** is not surjective since no element in A is mapped to 5 in B. However, it is injective because it maps distinct elements of A to distinct elements in B.\n\n2. **Function g** is not injective since it maps both 3 and 5 to the same element in C (6). However, it is surjective since every element in C has a pre-image in B (either 3 or 4).\n\nNow, let's examine the composition g∘f for elements in A:\n\n(g∘f)(1) = g(f(1)) = g(3) = 6\n(g∘f)(2) = g(f(2)) = g(4) = 7\n\nWe can see that g∘f is:\n\n- **Injective**: Each distinct element in A is mapped to a distinct element in C.\n- **Surjective**: Every element in C is the image of some element in A through the composition g∘f.\n\nTherefore, the composition g∘f is a bijective function, even though neither f nor g is bijective by themselves. So, this counterexample disproves the initial statement.",
