      "content": "Star Academy is a musical reality show that also incorporates many of the elements of the Big Brother format. 14 contestants (the Talents) are locked up for three months in an isolated house called the Academy, where viewers watch them become real music stars. Unlike Big Brother, the participants are not isolated from the outside world to such an extent. Besides the weekly live concerts, they also leave the Academy for meetings with fans, from whom they also receive letters. Talents sometimes have visits from their relatives and friends, or have the right to a short telephone conversation with them. Another difference with Big Brother is that contestants are also provided with newspapers.\n\nHere too, the Talents are monitored 24 hours a day, but there are no cameras in the toilets and the bathroom. Star Academy is a show that focuses more on the talent and development of the contestants than their personal lives.\n\nEvery Monday, the talents perform a big concert in front of an audience at the Star Academy studio. They have been preparing for their performances throughout the past week, and the course of the nominations and eliminations depends on their performance.\n\nEach of the Talents performs at least one song, and duets, trios, quartets are also often performed. Almost every time, big music stars are also guests, who sometimes also join the performances.\n\nThe concerts are broadcast live on television, and the next day the participants watch a recording of the show and discuss it with their teachers.\n\nEach week, the Academy Director consults with the teachers and together they decide who the three nominated talents will be for expulsion from the Academy. Teachers make this decision based on their observations over the past week. They announce their nominations every Monday, at the end of the live concert. The next day, in a short taping live from the Academy, each of the talents chooses one of the three nominees they want to save. The one with the most votes stays for sure, and phone lines are opened against the other two, where viewers downvote their exclusion (as in Big Brother).\n\nEvery week, at least one big star from the show business visits the Academy, and talks to the talents, gives them different advice about their professional development."
