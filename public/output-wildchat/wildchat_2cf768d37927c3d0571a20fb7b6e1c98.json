Which of the following statements is a poor justification for choosing sugar as an experimental variable?\n\nGroup of answer choices\n\nSugar is cheap and easy to work with\n\nSugar has inhibited enzymes that are similar to the enzyme they are testing\n\nIn the body, this enzyme is only found in tissues with high glucose concentrations\n\nAnother study tested the impact of sugar on enzyme activity but had inconclusive results"

      "content": "The statement \"Another study tested the impact of sugar on enzyme activity but had inconclusive results\" is a poor justification for choosing sugar as an experimental variable. Just because a previous study had inconclusive results does not mean that glucose should be chosen as the experimental variable. It would be more scientifically valid to base the experimental variable selection on the other provided options, such as the affordability and ease of working with sugar, or the specific biological relevance of glucose concentrations in tissues where the enzyme is found."

      "content": "A group of students hypothesize that adding Chemical B to their enzyme solution will result in lower enzyme activity. Before running their experiment, they need to decide what concentration of ONPG they will use. They complete the Bio150 enzyme-substrate experiment and generate the following figure:\n\nimage.png\n\nIf the students anticipate Chemical B could raise the enzyme activity level, which substrate concentration would be a poor choice to test?\n\nGroup of answer choices\n\n20\n\n8\n\n10\n\nThe concentration of ONPG doesn't matter"

      "content": "The answer would be \"10\" because at a substrate concentration of 10, the enzyme activity is already very high. Therefore, it would be difficult to observe any potential increase in enzyme activity caused by Chemical B if the activity is already close to the maximum."

      "content": "The answer would be \"It does not have replicates.\" In order to obtain reliable and statistically significant results, it is important to have replicates for each concentration of Chemical Y. This means measuring the enzyme activity multiple times for each concentration to account for any variability or experimental errors. Without replicates, it is difficult to make confident conclusions about the effect of Chemical Y on enzyme function."
