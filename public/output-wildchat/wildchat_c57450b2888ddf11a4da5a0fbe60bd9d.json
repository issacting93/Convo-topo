When someone uses the term \"extreme TLDR,\" they usually mean a summary that is condensed to just a sentence or two, capturing only the most essential point or points from a longer text, conversation, or discussion. Its purpose is to provide an immediate understanding of the core idea without going into detail. This can be useful in situations where time is of the essence or when someone wants to quickly grasp the main concept without any frills."

      "content": "As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have direct access to API keys or the ability to generate API keys for applications. API keys are unique identifiers that are used to authenticate requests to an API (Application Programming Interface). They are provided by the API service provider to registered users or developers.\n\nIf you are referring to an API key to use OpenAI services, such as the GPT models, you would need to:\n\n1. Visit the OpenAI website (https://openai.com/).\n2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.\n3. Access the API section and register your application to receive an API key.\n\nKeep in mind that API keys are sensitive and should be kept secret. Do not share your API key publicly or with unauthorized users, as it can be used to access services and might incur costs if it's a paid service.\n\nFurthermore, if you are referring to an API key for a specific app other than OpenAI, you would need to refer to the documentation or support services of that app for instructions on how to obtain an API key."
