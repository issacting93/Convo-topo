Of course, some days have gotten a lot less normal when my now-husband MC joined, but at least we finally have a normal day. Of course, I was 7 months pregnant with our twins - a girl named Sachiko and a boy named Satori - at the time, and they were extremely active today - they just wouldn't stop kicking.)",

They must know they're going to have the best parents in the world.\n\nSayori: *blushing and rubbing her belly* Aww, you always know how to make me feel special, MC. I can't wait to meet them, but these kicks are starting to feel like a tiny soccer match in there.\n\nMC: Maybe they're going to be future athletes, just like their mom.\n\nSayori: *laughs* Oh no, I hope they take after you with your artistic talent too. Can you imagine if they become renowned painters or musicians?\n\nMC: That would be incredible, but most importantly, I hope they find whatever makes them truly happy. Our children's happiness is all that matters.\n\nSayori: *smiles warmly* You're absolutely right, MC. As long as they're happy, I'll be the happiest mom in the world. But let's hope they don't kick too hard during classes. I don't want the teachers to get concerned.\n\nMC: We can always let the teachers know about their energetic nature. They'll understand. Plus, they'll probably find it adorable.\n\nSayori: I hope so. I just want everything to go smoothly. Pregnancy has brought so many changes, but having you by my side makes it all worth it.\n\nMC: And I'll always be by your side, no matter what. You're the strongest person I know, Sayori, and I'm in awe of you every day.\n\nSayori: *teary-eyed* MC, you always know how to make me feel loved. I'm the luckiest girl in the world to have you as my partner and the father of our children.\n\nMC: And I'm the luckiest guy in the world to have you as my wife and the mother of our children. We're going to make the best team, Sayori.\n\nSayori: *sniffles* Yes, we will. Our little family will be filled with love and happiness. I can't wait to embark on this beautiful journey with you, MC.\n\nMC: And I can't wait to meet our little Sachiko and Satori. They're going to be just as amazing as their parents.\n\n(They share a tender moment, feeling the warmth and joy radiating between them. Their love for each other and their unborn children is a testament to the incredible bond they share. As the kicks continue, they both laugh and cherish this wondrous time in their lives.)",

I feel like I'm being used as their personal trampoline.\n\nMC: *chuckles sleepily* They certainly have a lot of energy. Maybe they're prepping for a gymnastics routine or something.\n\nSayori: *giggles* Maybe. But right now, I just want them to give their poor mama a break. My belly feels like it's being invaded by little squirrels.\n\nMC: *sighs sleepily* I'm sorry, Sayori. I know it's uncomfortable for you. Shall I massage your belly a bit? It might help calm them down.\n\nSayori: *smiles gratefully* That would be lovely, MC. Maybe your magic touch can calm them down.\n\n(MC gently rubs Sayori's belly, soothingly massaging the area where the kicks are coming from. Sayori melts into the pillow, feeling a wave of relief.)\n\nSayori: Mmm, that feels nice, MC. Thank you.\n\nMC: Anything for you, my love. I just want you to be comfortable.\n\n(Slowly, the kicks start to decrease in frequency and intensity. The twins seem to be settling down.)\n\nSayori: Look, they're finally relaxing. I guess they just needed a little reassurance from their wonderful dad.\n\nMC: *grinning* Or maybe they heard how amazing their mom is and decided to give her a break.\n\nSayori: *giggles softly* You always know how to make me feel better, MC. I'm so lucky to have you.\n\nMC: And I'm lucky to have you, Sayori. You're carrying our beautiful twins, and I couldn't be prouder.\n\nSayori: *snuggling closer* I love you, MC.\n\nMC: I love you too, Sayori. And I love our little partners in crime, no matter how much they kick.\n\n(Softly, they drift off to sleep, the excitement of the twins' kicks replaced by the warmth of their love. Their love and support for each other carry them through the challenges of pregnancy, reminding them of the incredible journey they are about to embark on as parents.)",
