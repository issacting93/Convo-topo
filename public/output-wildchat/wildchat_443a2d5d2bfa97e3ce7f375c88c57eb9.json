Here is a quick history of her career and the incidents that led to the termination of her contract\u2014and the end of Cara Dune\u2019s journey on The Mandalorian.\n\nGina Carano\u2019s pre-Star Wars career\nMixed martial arts superstar Gina Carano posing in her fighting attire during the Workout Media Day at the Legends Training Center in Los Angeles, California on September 17, 2008\n(Robert Laberge, Getty Images)\nBetween 2006 and 2009, Carano competed with the mixed martial arts (MMA) organization Elite Xtreme Combat and with the MMA and kickboxing organization Strikeforce. In 2009, Carano and Cris \u201cCyborg\u201d Justino became the first women to headline a major MMA event during their Strikeforce fight. Although her record was 7\u20131 at the time, Carano retired from competition after her defeat to Cyborg. Carano then transitioned from competitive fighting to acting.\n\nTwo years after her Strikeforce defeat, Carano was cast in her first significant role: the lead in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s action film Haywire (2011), alongside Antonio Banderas, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, and Channing Tatum. She was nominated for a Critics\u2019 Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie for her performance. Carano was then cast as Riley Hicks in Fast & Furious 6 (2013) and as Angel Dust in Deadpool (2016). \n\nGina Carano brings a fan favorite to The Mandalorian\nGina Carano as Cara Dune in a battle scene in The Mandalorian, walking through a building, armed with a rifle\n(Disney+)\nCarano moved from the world of superheroes to the Star Wars galaxy when she was cast as the Alderaanian bounty hunter Carasynthia \u201cCara\u201d Dune in The Mandalorian. Cara Dune became a fan favorite almost immediately upon her appearance in Chapter 4 (season 1, episode 4), \u201cSanctuary.\u201d Hasbro produced two action figures based on Carano\u2019s likeness: the 3.75-inch Retro Collection figure and the 6-inch Black Series Collection figure, which quickly sold out. Funko also produced a Pop! vinyl figure of Cara Dune in their signature cutesy style.\n\nHer character was featured on other licensed merchandise for The Mandalorian, and Carano seemed poised to become a long-term denizen of the Star Wars galaxy.\n\nHow Gina Carano lost the Way\nGina Carano as Cara Dune in 'The Mandalorian'\n(Disney+)\nIn 2021, a series of posts Carano made on her social media accounts elicited strong responses which quickly escalated into full-blown backlash. Many of those posts remain on Carano\u2019s social media accounts, including a tweet that challenges the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and blames the Biden administration for the deaths of vaccinated people. She also shared a story on her Instagram account that refers to the death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, implying that he was a victim of something conspiratorial: \u201cJeff Epstein didn\u2019t kill himself.\u201d \n\nWhen Carano was encouraged to add her personal pronouns to her Twitter profile, she instead added \u201cboop/bop/beep,\u201d which many perceived as an attempt to mock transgender and nonbinary people. She defended the choice in a tweet that read:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re mad cuz I won\u2019t put pronouns in my bio to show my support for trans lives. After months of harassing me in every way. I decided to put 3 VERY controversial words in my bio.. beep/bop/boop\n\nI\u2019m not against trans lives at all. They need to find less abusive representation.\u201d\n\nWhen fellow cast member Pedro Pascal (whose sister is trans) spoke with Carano about including personal pronouns in her social media profiles, she shared the following in a now-deleted tweet:\n\n\u201cYes, Pedro & I spoke & he helped me understand why people were putting them in their bios. I didn\u2019t know before but I do now. I won\u2019t be putting them in my bio but good for all you who choose to. I stand against bullying, especially the most vulnerable & freedom to choose.\u201d\n\nID, the public relations firm who represented Carano, dropped her around this time. But when she shared an Instagram story from another account, the situation became even more serious:\n\n\u201cJews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors\u2026even by children. Because history is edited, most people today don\u2019t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views.\u201d\n\nComparing the genocide of the Jews to the experience of being a conservative in post-Trump America was the breaking point for Disney. The day after Cara shared this story on her Instagram account, Lucasfilm released a statement saying, \u201cGina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future. Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable.\u201d Carano\u2019s agency, United Talent Artists, also terminated her contract.\n\nThe following day, Carano told Deadline: \u201cI am sending out a direct message of hope to everyone living in fear of cancellation by the totalitarian mob. I have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before, and I hope it inspires others to do the same.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on The Ben Shapiro Show, Carano described receiving an email she did not think was intended for her when Disney \u201caccidentally sent me an email, which was very enlightening, so I knew. I knew they were paying attention. I know there were some people who went to bat for me but I know that they didn\u2019t win out at the end.\u201d\n\nHer version of the events leading up to her firing was that Disney executives had been \u201call over me and they\u2019ve been watching me like a hawk, and I\u2019m watching people on the same production and they can say everything they want, and that\u2019s where I had a problem. I had a problem because I wasn\u2019t going along with the narrative.\u201d\n\nDespite being fired by Disney and no longer appearing in The Mandalorian (or the Rangers of the New Republic series, which may never be produced), Carano has continued to work in the film industry. In 2022, she directed her first feature, a western called Terror on the Prairie, about a frontier woman who protects her family from a gang of outlaws. Terror on the Prairie was produced by Ben Shapiro, but in a twist rivaled only by an M. Night Shyamalan script, Carano\u2019s own fan base\u2014a conservative-leaning audience\u2014criticized the film on social media as \u201cwoke nonsense.\u201d\n\n(featured image: Disney+)\n\nHave a tip we should know? <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>\n\nFILED UNDER:\nGina Carano\nPedro Pascal\nStar Wars (franchise)\nThe Mandalorian\nFOLLOW THE MARY SUE:\nJoin the Conversation\nARIA BACI - CONTRIBUTING WRITER\n\nAria Baci (she/her/hers) is a writer and cultural critic who has been working in print and digital media since 2015, for the now-archived Design*Sponge, Geeks OUT, Flame Con, and The Mary Sue.

Answered and Explained\nBy Rachel UlatowskiJul 17th, 2023, 6:46 am\n1 comment\n \nsubmit to reddit\nRosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano\nAhsoka Tano is getting her own solo Star Wars series, but did she ever attain the rank of a Jedi? Her new series, Ahsoka, is set to premiere on August 23, meaning it\u2019s time to freshen up our knowledge of the character. In the series, Rosario Dawson will be reprising her role as Tano after previously portraying the character in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. While Disney+\u2019s earlier Star Wars shows brought Tano over to the live-action realm, she actually has a more extensive history in the franchise\u2019s animated projects.\n\nTano (Ashley Eckstein) was first introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars as a Padawan under the mentorship of Anakin Skywalker (Matt Lanter). However, after Anakin turned to the Dark side, Tano forged her own path separate from her former friend and mentor. She became a very important figure in the Rebellion and had several adventures with the Ghost Crew in Star Wars Rebels. During her time as a rebel, she struck up a close friendship with Ezra Bridger (Taylor Gray). In Ahsoka, she will be setting out to find Ezra after he went missing at the end of Star Wars Rebels and will also be contending with a familiar foe.\n\nIn the latest trailer from Ahsoka, there is plenty of action as she teams up with Sabine Wren (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) to fight against Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen), who has risen again with nefarious plans. Tano can be seen wielding a lightsaber and looking very Jedi-like with her skills. However, there are mentions of her past that raise questions about her Jedi identity.\n\nAhsoka Tano\u2019s Jedi history is complicated\nAhsoka Tano readies to fight\n(Disney XD)\nWhether Tano is a Jedi is quite complicated. As mentioned above, Tano was once training to be a Jedi and was Anakin\u2019s Padawan. Being a Padawan is similar to being an apprentice and means that the individual is learning to be a Jedi, but is not yet a full-fledged member of the Jedi Order. In the Ahsoka trailer, Tano states, \u201cAnakin never got to finish my training. I walked away from him.\u201d While Tano walked away from Anakin after his betrayal, she actually also walked away from the Jedi Order before he even turned to the Dark Side. In season 5 of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Tano was framed for a terrorist bombing of the Jedi Temple. Although the charges were ultimately dropped, she went through quite a traumatic experience being arrested and put on trial, causing her to leave the Jedi Order behind.\n\nSo, it wasn\u2019t just that her training wasn\u2019t completed, but that she personally chose to walk away from the Jedi Order. In Star Wars Rebels, her position remained the same as she staunchly denied being a Jedi. However, where things get confusing is in the live-action Star Wars shows. In The Mandalorian, Tano is referred to as a Jedi by Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and seems to be involved in Luke Skywalker\u2019s (Mark Hamill) Jedi Temple. Then, the first Ahsoka teaser also refers to her as a Jedi, including it in a long list of labels to introduce her.\n\nFortunately, Dave Filoni shed some light on why Tano is called a Jedi in The Mandalorian. He told Vanity Fair, \u201c[Fans] all focus very hard on the line, \u2018I am no Jedi,\u2019 from Star Wars: Rebels, but it\u2019s undeniable that she\u2019s trained by the Jedi. I think to most observers she is very Jedi to them. I would argue in some ways\u2014by being so selfless and rejecting a lot of paths that would have given her power\u2014she\u2019s more Jedi-like than even some characters who claim to be Jedi.\u201d This confirms that some individuals in the Star Wars universe do consider Tano a Jedi. However, the question that remains is, does she see herself as a Jedi?\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s difficult to know what\u2019s going on in Tano\u2019s head. She may be tolerant of others referring to her as a Jedi, but she has never explicitly stated what her stance is now, considering many years have gone by. It\u2019s possible that she did change her mind over the years, but it can\u2019t be assumed without her confirmation. Hence, unless Tano declares otherwise, it seems she\u2019s not technically a Jedi since she did walk away from the Order all those years ago and never indicated she reversed that decision, but she can\u2019t stop others from still seeing and labeling her as a Jedi.\n\n(featured image: Disney+)\n\nHave a tip we should know? <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>",
