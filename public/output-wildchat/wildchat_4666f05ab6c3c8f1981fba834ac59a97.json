And no single organization can save it either. That is why everything OpenMedia does is about placing citizens at the heart of digital policy. Our digital future is just too important to be left to industry lobbyists and government bureaucrats. OpenMedia engages, educates, and empowers people through long-term citizen-driven campaigns. For this, it is important to ensure that citizen voices are at the heart of the debate. We ensure citizens can have their say through accessible online actions, innovative participatory tools, and through Internet Town Halls and other events.\nHaving gathered citizen input, we do our utmost to make sure those voices are heard at the heart of government. We do so by appearing at regulatory proceedings, meeting with politicians, creating online tools that make it easy for citizens to take part in regulatory processes, and by leveraging media coverage to encourage decision-makers to listen to citizens. Working with Canadians, OpenMedia has developed crowd-sourced, informed, in-depth research that shapes our policy plans. This approach is having a real impact and has led to a signiﬁcant improvement in recent years in terms of how the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunica- tions Commission (CRTC) listens to Canadians.\n\nImagine it is the year 2020 and you’ve been having a frustrating day. You’ve just been stopped at the border—the US guard wouldn’t tell you why, but you guess it is because of something you said or did online recently. They collect so\n\nmuch data on your everyday life these days that it’s diﬃcult to know what, or why they red-ﬂagged you. It’s been happening to a lot of your friends recently too (Bridge 2011).\nReturning home, you log on to your Internet account. It’s costing you over two hundred Canadian dollars a month for this, and some days you wonder why you bother. You still enjoy connecting with people, but so much content is oﬀ limits nowadays that your Internet is feeling more and more like cable TV (Isaacson 2014). That extra twenty-dollar monthly fee to access Facebook still annoys you—and you just can’t ﬁnd the money needed to access online news content other than from your sensationalist local TV station. At least that sta- tion comes as part of your Internet package because it is owned by your pro- vider—but to access the BBC would be an extra twenty-ﬁve dollars a month, and your provider blocks access to other online news portals completely.\nChecking your e-mail, you discover a threatening letter (Brown 2013) from a US media giant. It seems to have something to do with a song your six-year-old niece accidentally downloaded when she visited a few months ago. The e-mail warns that under copyright rules negotiated under a previous Trans Paciﬁc Partnership, you will be kicked oﬀ the Internet entirely if it happens again (Desjardins 2013), and now you’ve got to pay an extortionate ﬁne to avoid getting taken to court.\nAt the same time, you are acutely aware that storing everything everyone says or does online in giant government databases comes at a cost to taxpayers. And you’re constantly worried that you’ll be the victim of a massive leak of your private data (Bennett 2014)—it seems the government just can’t keep anything secure.\nYou fondly remember the good old days, where you could read and connect privately with whoever you wanted online. It hasn’t been like that for years— not since those old net neutrality rules were struck down and your Internet provider started blocking or charging extra for content it didn’t own. And you have no option outside the high-cost Big Telecom Internet providers since they succeeded in blocking you from more aﬀordable, independent services. You wonder why you didn’t make more of a fuss about that at the time.\nDoes all this sound terrifying? Thankfully, we are still some way oﬀ from this dystopian vision of the future. But we are already on a very slippery slope and this is exactly what the Internet could look like in a few years if citizens step back and leave digital policy to telecom lobbyists and spy agency bureaucrats. OpenMedia exists to stop this from happening—it is an award-winning community-based organization that safeguards the possibilities of the open Internet. We work toward informed and participatory digital policy by engag-\ning hundreds of thousands of people in protecting our online rights.\nWe do this work because digital policy aﬀects each and every one of us. Our high cell phone bills are holding back our economy and Canada as a whole. Mass surveillance of law-abiding citizens has grown secretive, expensive, and\n \nout-of-control—stiﬂing free speech in Canada and overseas. And supposed trade deals negotiated behind closed doors contain extreme Internet censorship rules that would seriously undermine citizens’ ability to communicate freely online.\nIf we stood back and did nothing then at best we’d end up with an Internet that was far more expensive, locked down, censored, and policed. And, if recent challenges in the United States to net neutrality are anything to go by, we may not even have an Internet at all—at least not as we know it today. That’s why, at OpenMedia, we work for digital policies that make sense for all users of the Internet—policies that help build the open, connected society we all deserve.\n\nCASE STUD Y OF A SUCCESSFUL REFORM STRATEGY \nOur campaign on reshaping Canadian wireless policy oﬀers a compelling example of how the OpenMedia community works to bring about positive change. Canadians pay some of the highest prices in the industrialized world for often patchy and unreliable wireless service. This has been conﬁrmed time and again by independent reports (Christopher 2013). Many Canadians have no choice but to pay the high prices on oﬀer by the Big Three: Bell, Rogers, and Telus. These three providers control over 90 percent of the market, meaning many Canadians have no independent options whatsoever.\nIn January 2012, we launched the “Stop the Squeeze” campaign, which urged Canadians to speak out against the Big Three’s near-oligopoly. As part of this campaign we launched an online petition—along with videos, post- ers, and viral share images—to equip Canadians with the tools needed to speak up and pressure decision-makers. Over sixty-ﬁve thousand Canadians took part and in October 2012 the CRTC announced a public consultation to create new national rules for wireless services. At OpenMedia we wanted to make sure that these reﬂected the lived realities of Canadian cell phone users. We created a new online tool to enable Canadians to share their cell phone horror stories about the eﬀect high wireless prices and poor service had on their daily lives.\nOver three thousand submissions were received through this campaign— some of which consisted of multiple pages detailing remarkable mistreatment at the hands of the Big Three. A common complaint was from Canadians returning home after trips to the United States or overseas to receive staggering bills for roaming charges. This citizen input was used to create a crowdsourced report entitled Time for an Upgrade (OpenMedia 2013) that reﬂected how Canadians wanted to see the wireless market reformed. During a crowdsourced presentation to the CRTC, the key themes of this report were reinforced: lower prices, greater choice, and better service. Canadians were kept informed via live tweets and online updates from the CRTC hearing.\n \nOpenMedia focused on making the case that any new wireless code of conduct must be grounded in the evidence-based realities that our campaign had high- lighted. In June 2013 this work paid oﬀ—the CRTC announced a broadly posi- tive new set of customer protection rules (Rennie 2013) that capped data roaming rates, shortened contracts, and made it easier to switch to a new provider.\nBy this time, it seemed that decision-makers were starting to listen to Cana- dians but there was still a long way to go. Despite these new customer protec- tions, independent reports revealed that wireless prices were still increasing at thirteen times the rate of inﬂation (CNW 2013). Canadians were also con- cerned about attempts by large telecom providers such as Rogers and Telus to take over scarce wireless spectrum resources that had been set aside for inde- pendent providers.\nAs focus shifted from customer protections to the need for greater wireless choice, over forty leading Canadian innovators and entrepreneurs spoke out to tell Industry Canada that high prices were stiﬂing job creation and holding Canada’s economy back. Responding to this pressure, the government announced new rules (Industry Canada 2013) to help prevent the Big Three from taking over independent providers.\nWith a new industry minister, James Moore, taking oﬃce we encouraged Canadians to send a message asking him to stop the Big Three acting as gate- keepers to resources that were essential for Canada’s economy. We underlined the need for the government to listen to Canadians, whose crowdsourced roadmap called for opening the wireless networks to deliver real aﬀordability and choice. Once again, citizen pressure delivered results, with the new indus- try minister promising to take modest steps to ensure independent providers could access wireless networks at an aﬀordable rate (Market Wired 2013), along with ﬁnancial penalties for telecom giants who break the rules. Notably, the government has eﬀectively staked its reputation on delivering “more choice and lower prices”—even launching a government website and a TV ad cam- paign to underline this goal. This would never have happened without citizens speaking out en masse and working together to provide a positive roadmap for policy change.\n\nTHE INTERNET IS  KE Y TO  B UILDING A PA RTICIPATORY SHARED SOCIET Y\nOpenMedia has seen again and again that when people speak up en masse, it really does make a diﬀerence—delivering real results and positive change. The common theme with all our successful campaigns is our emphasis on citizen participation. Our community is placed at the heart of everything OpenMedia does—whether that is crowdsourcing reports, policy plans, presentations, and even meetings with government ministers.\n \nWhen designed well, OpenMedia’s campaigns eﬀectively act as platforms for broad-based citizen engagement and collaboration. It is important to ensure that citizens play the key role in shaping campaigns, from messaging and tactics all the way to long-term policy solutions. Time after time, it is citizens’ decisions to participate in campaigns that has ultimately led to their success. Together, our growing community has accomplished some remarkable things in a short period of time—whether overturning invasive government spying schemes or stopping pans to install a pay meter on the Internet.\nSadly, the need for OpenMedia’s work has not diminished. Eﬀorts to spy on private online activity, to censor the Internet, and to price-gouge Canadians on their monthly Internet bills make clear that the Internet continues to need people who are willing to work to defend it. By coming together online, citi- zens are demonstrating why the Internet is key to a future where collaboration and participation are hallmarks of our democracy. We are really just beginning to explore the Internet’s potential for building a democracy that truly responds to citizens’ needs. With threats to the Internet intensifying, it seems that we are at a tipping point: Either we stand back and let leaders, bureaucrats, and lob- byists tip us back into disempowerment, or we step forward to build a partici- patory shared future that works for all of us.\n"

During this time AMEDI has developed a number of eﬀective strategies, which include: constant advocacy, by organizing conferences and symposiums, providing relevant information through their website and public communiques and cementing an eclectic but uniﬁed front against media power; permanent monitoring, by identifying in National Congress all MPs with close personal or professional connections to big media and evaluating the performance of media regulators and key civil servants; strategic litigation, by ﬁghting in court commer- cial transactions carried out by media corporations which could further entrench media concentration and contesting in the Supreme Court of Justice the constitu- tionality of particular pieces of legislation; and research and policy-making exer- cises, by publishing academic books and drafting media law to be submitted for legislative consideration. Alongside an advantageous political environment and the pressure asserted by a dynamic student movement, these strategies have been responsible for the 2013 telecommunications reform and the transformation of the legal framework regulating media in Mexico.\n\nFor the ﬁrst time in half a century, the legal framework regulating media in Mexico has been comprehensively reformed. A number of far-reaching\n\nconstitutional amendments approved in June 2013 will radically change the way radio and television are regulated in the country, opening up a highly monopolized market and raising the possibilities for the creation of a national public broadcasting service. Among the most relevant changes brought up by this reform was the creation of the Federal Institute of Tele- communications (IFT to use its Spanish acronym), a new regulator which, unlike its predecessor, is constitutionally independent from both the Presi- dency and Congress. The IFT will have the authority to implement asym- metric regulation and the tools to impose multi-million peso ﬁnes. IFT will have both ﬁnancial and administrative independence and their commission- ers are now selected through a publicly sanctioned process. In a country in which radio and television was born out of the intimate connections between a small number of aﬄuent families and politicians, these reforms represent an attempt to sever the murky and, at times, illegal connections between media moguls and government oﬃcials.\nPerhaps more importantly, the 2013 telecommunications reform recognize the duty of the state in the creation of a diverse and plural media environment: both the right to information and the right to access to information and com- munication technologies (ICT) are now constitutional prerogatives. In addi- tion, a number of previously inoperable laws, from the right to reply to the laws protecting personal privacy, are to be harmonized in new secondary legis- lation. Although the laws necessary to implement these far-reaching reforms have yet to be developed, most social commentators and academics recognize the unprecedented possibilities these reforms will bring to the media ecology of the country. This chapter, however, does not explore the particularities of these constitutional reforms, but focuses instead on the sociopolitical circumstances that made them possible and, in particular, on the strategies used by Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI), the largest and most ener- getic media reform group in the country.\nAs Silvio Waisbord (2000, 50) has rightly pointed out, like in most other Latin American countries, radio and television in Mexico was for many years caught between “the hard rock of the state and the hard place of the market.” At the dawn of broadcasting technologies, the countries of the region—ruled by military regimes or by authoritarian political elites—adopted a liberal media model which left to the market the introduction and operation of these new services. In fact, political control over radio and television was a key element in the longevity of these administrations; this inﬂuence, however, was not exer- cised through direct ownership or management. In postrevolutionary Mexico, broadcasting was controlled through a complex system of patronage and com- mercial links, in which media owners were allowed to conduct their commer- cial aﬀairs undisrupted as long as they showed unquestionable loyalty to the hegemonic party and in particular to the president in turn. When comparing media systems, Hallin and Papathanassopoulos (2002) use the term clientelism\n \nto describe the way countries in southern Europe and Latin America organize their media industries; they describe media systems in which “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for defer- ence and various kinds of support” (ibid., 184–185).\nThe combination of the unﬂinching backing from authoritarian regimes and the ﬁnancial resources generated by thinly regulated markets produced a num- ber of extremely wealthy and powerful corporations. By the mid-1970s, a hand- ful of groups in Mexico owned most radio stations in the country and the Azcárraga family had total control over most television stations. In 1990 Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, father of Emilio Azcárraga Jean, current CEO of Televisa, famously declared himself to be “a solider of the party” (Fernandez and Pax- man 2013). All through the twentieth century, the Azcárraga family maintained strong connections to the leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI to use the Spanish abbreviation), the hegemonic organization which ruled Mexico for 70 years. These links allowed the company to fend oﬀ any attempt to modify the archaic laws which supposedly regulated their industry. In fact, as María de la Luz Casas Pérez (2006, 96) has suggested, media regula- tion almost always “appeared by request [of the media corporations] in order to formalize already existing favourable conditions or to ensure their future stability.” Politicians and academics (Esteinou and de la Silva 2009; Trejo Delarbre 2009) have even implied that pieces of media legislation were often written by the legal department of Televisa rather than by elected MPs.\nIn Mexico, unlike other countries in the region, the slow process toward democracy which began in the late 1980s and accelerated during the 1990s, was not wholeheartedly supported by any major media corporation. As Hallin (2000, 103) has stated, Televisa actively resisted democratization and most “commercial broadcasters, far from leading the charge to pluralism, had to be dragged kicking and screaming by the state.” Media companies dreaded a decline in inﬂuence a diﬀerent political party could bring and kept their options open. However, the adoption of a multiparty system in which electoral results were respected and the balance of power eﬀectively shifted did very little to curtail their inﬂuence on the political and social life of the country. The fact they never fully adopted an ideological position and pursued instead purely commercial interests, allowed most of the largest corporations to be ﬂexible enough to cozy up to all parties, including opposition forces which relied on publicity to be elected.\nRather than auguring media plurality and the decentralization of the media market, the 2000 presidential election in which the PRI was ﬁnally ousted, tragically increased the power of these corporations. In pursuit of the media exposure considered vital for electoral victory, politicians of all parties tried to outbid each other in the purchase of airtime. This dynamic, alongside hefty contracts for political advertising, gave media lobbyists huge political lever- age. In the following decade, media corporations were not afraid to use this\n \ninﬂuence, pushing outrageous legislation through their proxies in Congress; for example, they forced the president to slash their taxes by 1,000 percent (Trejo Delarbre 2010; Esteinou and de la Silva 2009). By the 2006 presidential election the entire political class was eﬀectively being blackmailed by Televisa, the largest Spanish-speaking media cooperation in the world.\n\nTHE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND MEDIA REFORM \nIn the last couple of years, a number of Latin America countries, from Argentina to Nicaragua, have fundamentally changed the way they regulate and organize their media. Just like in Mexico, many of these changes were, at least in part, the result of a sustained campaign by media reform groups. Activists, academics and university students began to create organizations that strived to democratize the media and make the connections between authorities and media owners pub- licly accountable. The Latin American media observatories, which Maria del Mar Rodríguez Rosell and Beatriz Correyero Ruiz (2008, 23) describe as “orga- nizations which deliver a critical look at the global media system and have as a common objective its democratization,” diﬀer from country to country (Her- rera 2005; Rey 2003) but the great majority of them shared a “reformist agenda” (Herrera 2006). These organizations have been at the forefront of all major media reform movements in the region and are a rich environment in which alternative models of media production and distribution are tested. However, unlike other countries in South and Central America (Waisbord 2010), no Mexican media observatory has been fully endorsed by a political party and comprehensive media reform has never been part of any government’s agenda. Contrary to countries like Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Ven- ezuela, in which populist governments “dovetail with longstanding demands by civic groups, namely, the need to restrict the power of large media corporations and diversify media ownership” (ibid., 99), Mexican reform groups had only limited inﬂuence within the established political system. It was therefore some- what surprising to witness the scope and progressive outlook of the 2013 tele- communications reform. Before concentrating on the strategies employed by the most prominent media reform group in the country, this section explores two sociopolitical events that might help to explain such a dramatic change. Alongside the strategies used by AMEDI, the YoSoy132 (IAm132) student movement and the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party to the presi- dency are key elements that help to explain the recent legal transformations.\n\nTHE CONNECTIvE LOGIC OF YOSOY 132 \nYoSoy132 is a student movement that erupted two months before the 2012 presidential election. The result of an incident which took place at a private\n \nuniversity, the movement was a popular reaction to a political snub: a group of students who demonstrated against the visit of Enrique Peña Nieto, the then front-runner in the presidential race and today’s Mexican president, were pub- licly called hooligans and political pawns by members of his campaign. In what would become very relevant, not only did the major television channels distort their grievances and opinions but they questioned their identities as students. Using mobile phone recordings, the students at the Iberoamerican University (Ibero) contested the oﬃcial version of events by posting a number of videos on YouTube and ﬂooding social media with their own account. On May 14, three days after the incident, 131 protesters posted a video in which they showed their student IDs and conﬁrmed their presence in the original protest. This video not only went viral, but was soon picked up by radio and television sta- tions, if not by the largest corporations. This video “would end up shaking the electoral atmosphere like nothing else before, in a presidential campaign which had given the impression to be immobile” (Galindo Cáceres and Gonzáles- Acosta 2013, 83). When students at other universities began to be aware of the movement and identify with it, they considered themselves to be the 132nd protester, even if they had only been virtually there. They used the YoSoy132 hashtag to make their struggle public through the use of social media but also to identify themselves as joveNets, or networked-youngsters (Candón Mena 2013), the young “digital natives” who are proﬁcient in the use of digital tech- nologies and are not passive consumers of “old media.”\nAlthough the movement soon took to the streets and organized regional\nrallies and assemblies, YoSoy132 followed what Lance Bennett and Alexandra Segerberg (2012) have described as the logic of connective action. By adopting horizontal methods of decision-making and heavily relying on social media for making their struggle public, the movement escalated exponentially and gained central stage in the political agenda. With its use of “easily personalized ideas” (ibid., 744) and its rejection of hierarchies, the students were able to generate an incredible momentum which took politicians and social commentators by surprise. By May 23, just over a week after the ﬁrst incident, tens of thousands of young protesters marched through Mexico City and held a massive assembly near the city center. Not all protesters identiﬁed themselves as members of the\nYoSoy132 movement (Meneses Rocha, Ortega Gutiérrez, and Urbina Cortés 2013), but it was precisely the ideological ﬂexibility of the movement and its lack of formal membership which allowed the formation of an eclectic group, able to accommodate diverse and dissimilar demands: from calling for an end to the War on Drugs to demanding respect and legal protection for unionized labor.\nNevertheless, and despite having no formal leadership to script a manifesto or a coherent set of demands to present to Congress, media democratization soon became the core exigency of the movement; it became the only idea that bonded all protesters together. Rather than directing their outrage against a\n \nparticular political party or candidate, most students identiﬁed mainstream media, and in particular Televisa and TV Azteca, as the main target and the biggest threat to the democratic process. As Gabriel Sosa Plata (2012, 103) has clearly described: “Why do young people talk about the need to democratize media? Because, as a matter of fact, television is an overwhelming presence in all Mexican homes, in particular the two companies [which control most of the airwaves]. No other media has these levels of penetration, coverage and national reach.”\nThe students considered media corporations a vestige of an undemocratic and authoritarian past which they no longer recognized and began to employ digital technologies as organizational tools while at the same time using social media as performative acts of resistance. During demonstrations students hold banners with slogans such as: “They have the TV, we have social networks” and “Televisa: Welcome to the Digital Age!” In an interesting twist of events, the demographic who consumed traditional broadcasting content the least—the young, metropolitan, tech-savvy university student—was the sector of society that recognized radio and television stations as important centers of political power. Even without setting up a detailed action plan or developing a clear political agenda, YoSoy132 was crucial in bringing media reform to the fore. Nonetheless, without the endorsement of the political elite, far-reaching amendments to the Constitution would have never been possible, even after a popular protest of such a scale. Taking this into consideration, the election of Enrique Peña Nieto and his subsequent political maneuvering are crucial to understand the circumstances which made media reform possible.\n\nTHE RETURN OF THE pRI \nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the 2013 telecommunications reform is the fact it was not only encouraged but actively supported by Peña Nieto. The changes to the Constitution, which might seriously jeopardize the interests of media owners, were sponsored by a politician widely considered to be in cahoots with the media, particularly with Televisa. Even before running for the presidency, Peña Nieto made use of radio, television, and print media as key elements in his political strategy, spending millions in advertising during his time as governor of the State of Mexico. He relied very heavily on public rela- tions and fostered close links to the owners of radio and television stations (Villamil 2009). In November 2010 these connections became personal, when Peña Nieto married Angélica Rivera, a successful soap opera actress with a very long history of working for Televisa. Arguably, one of the reasons which made Peña Nieto decide to push for media reform during its ﬁrst year in oﬃce was an attempt to clean up his image and distance himself from the corporations that helped him to get elected. During the seventy years the PRI controlled the country, it was often the case that when a new president took oﬃce, an element\n \nof the old administration had to be sacriﬁced in order to maintain legitimacy. The recent reforms have been seen by some as an act of legitimization (Calleja 2013; Sosa Plata 2013).\nA more direct factor in the political support shown for these reforms was the Pact for Mexico (Pacto por México), a political agreement signed by leaders of the three main political parties days after Peña Nieto took oﬃce. The pact seeks “to accomplish reforms that have been obstructed by political gridlock” (Sada 2013) and listed a number of areas in which all parties agreed to work together. The pact aimed at speeding up the law-making process by establishing a com- mittee in charge of drafting legislation with cross-bench support and giving them legislative priority. Although fraught with diﬃculties, the agreement allowed for a relatively smooth transition through Congress and prompted the 2013 Telecommunications Reforms to be approved in record time. It is to expect that without this political environment, all the eﬀorts of an engaged civil society would still have not been enough to produce the changes recently experienced in the country. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize the work done by academics and media activists who for the last twenty years have worked for such reforms. Without their input, the perfect storm which encouraged this change would have never produced such a promising transformation.\n\nTHE MEXICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION \nInstead of enforcing control through coercion, the PRI was skilled in subsum- ing dissent through collusion. During most of its time in power, the party could accommodate diverse and contrasting interests, from peasant’s move- ments to chambers of commerce, within its ﬂexible hierarchy. It diﬀused con- ﬂict by granting positions within its structure to every potential opponent, while strongly prosecuting those who rejected. Although there were moments of violent repression, most famously the 1968 student massacre at the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, Mexico escaped most of the killings and disappearances com- mon to other regimes in the region. This culture of collusion made the devel- opment of civil society organizations particularly diﬃcult, since it undermined possibilities for organized political resistance. Nevertheless, since the mid-1990s civic participation and public engagement have started to play a larger role in the process of policy making. Successive Mexican governments, slowly and sometimes grudgingly, have begun to open “windows of opportunity” (Merino 2013) for the engagement of civil society in matters of public concern. It is in this new environment that media reform groups have begun to operate.\nFor over a decade, AMEDI has been the most eﬀective media observatory in the country, calling politicians and media owners to account and promoting media plurality as an essential element in the construction of democracy. With many of the characteristics shared by other Latin American observatories (Beas\n \nOropeza 2007; Correyero 2008), the association has been able to combine academic research with political advocacy, drawing together scholars, politi- cians, and journalists. AMEDI inherited a long history of research and radical action, rooted in the democratic struggles of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1999, after yet another failed attempt to push through Congress a comprehen- sive set of media reforms, a small group of academics, activists, and legislators decided to set up an organization that would “promote total respect, by gov- ernment as well as by the media, to the citizen’s rights to information, which must ensure that all Mexicans have access to truthful and objective information regarding matters of public concern” (AMEDI 2010). In a recent interview, two of its founding members, Senator Javier Corral and Professor Beatriz Solis, admitted creating AMEDI as an antidote to the inﬂuence the media lobby were able to exert on government. Until then, every attempt to modernize the laws regulating radio and television in the country had been defeated by the coordinated eﬀorts of the media corporations. Not only was every bill pub- licly and gratuitously attacked, often without even superﬁcial analysis, but the individuals sponsoring them soon became open targets. Televisa and TV Azteca were particularly vicious against any politician ﬂoating the idea of changing the media framework that, for half a century, had guaranteed their inﬂuence and wealth. Although commercial rivals, these two corporations have proven to be, time and time again, staunch political allies every time their interests are threatened.\n\nSOME AMEDI STRATEGIES \nSince its inception, AMEDI has made use of a variety of methods; I will focus my attention only on four of its most successful strategies: its advocacy, its work monitoring Congress and the civil service, its use of strategic litigation, and its research and policy-making eﬀorts. These tactics are often merged for speciﬁc campaigns; nonetheless they are suﬃciently distinct as to be described separately. Alongside the popular student movement and the favorable political atmosphere experienced after the 2012 presidential election, it is my contention that these strategies are responsible for the shape and scope of the 2013 telecom- munications reform.\nPerhaps the most important policy employed by AMEDI is its total commit- ment to public advocacy; no other organization has been able to promote media reform to such an extent. It has long been able to build high levels of social awareness and provide a clear alternative to the current paradigm. Part of this success is due to its diverse and committed membership, drawn from the entire political spectrum, who have been able to maintain pressure and a uni- ﬁed front even during the most adverse political times. AMEDI has become an ideological and political safe haven in which MPs, activists, and academics can openly discuss ideas without fear of censorship or peer pressure; consequently,\n \nit has become a fertile ground for cross-party cooperation. In addition, its members have developed a strong sense of identity which allows them to coor- dinate their eﬀorts eﬀectively.\nAMEDI’s members have also a permanent presence in the media, with regular columns in major newspapers and constant appearances in radio and television programs. The association produces and broadcasts Espacio AMEDI (2014), a weekly radio program which works as a platform for their campaigns while introducing topics such as freedom of information, participative democracy, and the right to information. It compiles a weekly newsletter in which all major media topics are discussed and which includes links to news- paper articles. In a country in which media issues are scattered around and diﬃcult to ﬁnd, this is a vital resource for anybody interested in the subject. The public recognition and trajectory of many of its members and support- ers—including well-known actors, respected ﬁlmmakers, and famous writ- ers—has given AMEDI considerable reputational resources. It is generally acknowledged as a serious, committed, and plural organization and its mem- bers possess considerable inﬂuence over key decision-makers, both in the business community and in Congress. However, its strategies go beyond inﬂicting “reputational costs” (Hevia de la Jara 2013), and many of their ideas are now central in debates around media reform.\nA second strategy used by AMEDI is the constant monitoring of major deci- sion makers, key policy players and relevant civil servants. Although it employs only a couple of full-time staﬀ and most of its members freely give their time and expertise, the association has been able to maintain regular oversight of Congress and all institutions with a stake in the legal framework of the media. Although it has been described as a media observatory, content analysis has yet to become an important element in its overall strategy. Instead, AMEDI has traditionally relied on quantitative research conducted independently by its members or on work done by other organizations, such as the Citizen Observa- tory for Gender Equality in the Media (Observatorio Ciudadano por la Equidad de Género en los Medios), which invites audiences to monitor sexist content on Mexican media. For a detailed analysis of state expenditure on oﬃcial publicity, AMEDI has relied on the Centre for Analysis and Research (Fundar). The asso- ciation can therefore be better described as a “political media observatory” or, following Consuelo Beas Oropeza’s (2007) classiﬁcation, as an observatory for supervision (observatorio de ﬁscalización).\nInterestingly, AMEDI asks its supporters, and Mexican society in general, to take part in their monitoring eﬀorts. After the 2012 general election, the asso- ciation launched the Telecracy is not Democracy! (¡Telecracia no es democracia!) campaign. This program identiﬁed members of Congress with close connec- tions to the media corporations and analyzed their individual legislative output as an exercise in accountability. The campaign identiﬁed a distinct and hetero- geneous group of MPs, from relatives of media owners and lawyers previously\n \nemployed by the corporations to former daytime presenters (MultimediA- MEDI 2012). AMEDI christened this group Telebancada (the Television Bench) and used this campaign to inform citizens about these connections and invite anybody interested to follow their legislative record. The campaign also showed how, in most cases, these MPs were not directly elected but accessed Congress through rules of electoral proportionality.\nSimilarly, AMEDI monitored the appointment of all the new members of the Federal Institute of Telecommunication. It not only closely followed the process itself but also led a public scrutiny of the successful candidates. Unfor- tunately, on its ﬁrst assessment, the association has concluded that four out of the seven commissioners did “not comply with the required experience and/or independence established by the Constitution” (AMEDI 2013). Although this type of monitoring does not always stop wrongdoings or bring the changes it advocates, it represents a method of accountability and a challenge to the deci- sions taken away from public scrutiny. The work done by AMEDI is an example of how the value of accountability can be institutionalized within a national media system.\nStrategic litigation has become another very successful strategy against attempts to further concentrate the media and telecommunication market in Mexico. AMEDI has ﬁled lawsuits and undertaken legal actions against the largest media corporations as a disruptive technique, forcing them to publicly defend some of their most dubious deals and sometimes even demonstrating the collusion between judges and media owners. The association has even chal- lenged the constitutionality of a number of bills introduced to Congress by their proxies: AMEDI’s most signiﬁcant legal victory to date has been the overturning of a number of reforms rushed through Parliament in 2006 in the midst of a hotly contested presidential election. The Televisa Law (Ley Televisa), as these reforms were dubbed at the time, attempted to modify “the Federal Law on Radio and Television” and would have expanded the dominance of Televisa and TV Azteca into areas of telecommunication and Internet provi- sion, granting them an unfair advantage in the process of digitalization (Estei- nou and de la Silva 2009). Among other concessions, Ley Televisa would have allowed for an automatic renewal of all media licenses and extended their validity from ﬁfteen to twenty years. It would have given existing corporations the possibility to fully exploit the dividends of digital switch-over, exempting them from additional taxation and making the appearance of new competitors extremely diﬃcult. In a highly monopolized market these concessions would have further entrenched the inﬂuence of the media duopoly.\nIn 2007, alongside other organizations and a number of MPs, AMEDI suc-\ncessfully challenged an act of unconstitutionality at the Mexican Supreme Court, nullifying Ley Televisa and paving the way for the 2013 telecommunica- tions reform. In addition, the publicity surrounding the litigation was a power-\n \nful vehicle for the socialization of media reform and demonstrated how the courts were a viable space in which to challenge the corporations and their political allies. Since then, AMEDI has continued to use lawsuits to advance its agenda. It has, for example, recently challenged the purchase by Televisa of 50 percent of mobile phone company Iusacell, on the basis that TV Azteca, its sole competitor in free-to-air commercial television, already owns the other 50 percent. This alliance would have created a dangerous and unconstitutional connection between the two major producers of media content in the country. Although the lawsuit was admitted by the courts, it was summarily dismissed due to legal technicalities; the Supreme Court has unfortunately shown no interest in further pursuing the case (AMEDI 2012), but there is now a prece- dent to follow. Aleida Calleja, who vigorously employed these tactics during her time as AMEDI’s president, is very clear on eﬀectiveness of litigation as a strategy to further the cause of media reform:\nI am convinced that to acquire new rights you have to litigate. Denouncing is not enough. I do not trust Congress. You have to win [these new rights] through facts on the ground. You need to make these topics public and then assert a legal precedent in court; this would inhibit illegal conduct by the corporations. You could shout and yell outside their oﬃces and nothing will happen. If we manage to succeed with these lawsuits, we will have strength- ened our position. (Calleja 2012)\nAn additional element in AMEDI’s strength resides in the fact that many media scholars in the country—alongside reputed legal experts, historians, and economists—are either members or supporters. The intellectual rigor of their contributions have been captured in the scholarly books AMEDI has published and the international conferences it has organized. Most publications (Ávila Pietrasanta, Calleja, and Solís Leree 2001; Bravo 2011; Solís Leree 2000; Trejo Delarbre et al. 2009; Trejo Delarbre and Montiel 2011) are edited volumes in which policy is carefully discussed and possible alternatives are delineated. As done by other media observatories in Latin America, AMEDI has positioned itself half way between a pressure group and a policy think-tank. The loyalty of its members is in part due to the clarity of its objective and the perceived illegal- ity of the actions of its opponents.\nThrough their members and supporters in Congress, the association has gained working knowledge not only on policy making but also of the politics behind constitutional reform. All these skills have been put to practice in the drafting of a bill, which in turn has been submitted to Congress for consideration. The Citizens’ Bill for a Convergent Law on Broadcasting and Telecommunication (Iniciativa Ciudadana de Ley Convergente en Materia de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión) is a comprehensive text which reﬂects years of research and aca- demic discussion. It aims to implement the constitutional amendments approved\n \nby the 2013 telecommunications reform, creating a new convergent law that could jointly regulate broadcasting and telecommunication services. The Citizens’ Bill (Iniciativa Ciudadana de Ley 2013) has a corpus of over 391 articles and represents an attempt to harmonize the new requirements established by the Constitution. The project has already been adopted by a good number of MPs and will soon be discussed in Congress.\nTwo fundamental elements on this Citizen’s Bill are its recognition of broad- casting as a social service, paying particular attention to the rights of audiences, and the reassertion of the state as the sole administrator of the airwaves. In contrast to the current legal framework, this bill does not consider broadcast- ing simply another industry within the capitalist market, but sees it as a vital building block in the construction of citizenship.\n\nCONCL USION \nBy the end of the 1970s, the culture of subordination which saw the birth of commercial broadcasting in Mexico was replaced by a culture of collusion, in which media owners and politicians haggle for concessions but work together for their mutual beneﬁt and the protection of a proﬁtable status quo. This period saw an unprecedented concentration of radio and television frequencies in the hands of a few party faithfuls and created the corporations that now monopolize the media market. Paradoxically, the transition to democracy experienced by the country in the last two decades, rather than diversifying the media environment and triggering an era of content plurality, has ushered in a culture of submission in which the entire political class could be blackmailed by the corporations. As Manuel Alejandro Guerrero (2010, 274) has pointed out, after the ousting of the PRI, radio and television stations “gained an enormous amount of symbolic power, facing a fragmented political class with an enor- mous need for airtime.”\nThe approval of the 2013 telecommunications reform hints at a shift in the balance of power and, for the ﬁrst time, it has introduced a new element in the process of media policy-making: an organized and capable civil society. The amendments to the Constitution approved by Congress still need to be imple- mented by secondary legislation and there is a real danger of a counter-reform promoted by the media lobby (Corral Jurado 2014). The winds have nonethe- less changed. The growing public awareness of the role played by the media in the democratic life of the country will make diﬃcult readopting cultures of subordination, collusion or submission, which have for so long characterized the relationship between politicians and media owners in Mexico. The strate- gies employed by AMEDI, from their commitment to advocacy to their strate- gic use of litigation, have ensured that media power is no longer unaccountable in the country.\n \n"

      "content": "### PART THREE: The Power of the Media Reform Movement\n\n### CHAPTER TEN: A Perfect Storm for Media Reform: Telecommunications Reforms in Mexico\n#### By Alejandro Abraham-Hamanoiel, Goldsmiths, University of London, United Kingdom\n\n#### MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY\nThe Mexican Association for the Right to Information (AMEDI) has been advocating for democratization of media in Mexico for over a decade, employing strategies that include advocacy, monitoring, strategic litigation, and research and policy-making. This relentless campaign has contributed significantly to the telecommunications reform of 2013, leading to changes in how radio and television are regulated and opening up a monopolized market for potential growth in national public broadcasting services.\n\n#### THE SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT BEHIND MEDIA REFORM\nHistorically, Mexican media was shaped by a relationship of clientelism between media conglomerates and the government. The media landscape was heavily influenced by a few wealthy families with close political ties, guaranteeing loyalty over regulatory interests. However, the recent sociopolitical landscape, influenced by AMEDI's efforts and student movements, along with the return of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to power, created a conducive environment for significant reforms.\n\n#### THE CONNECTIVE LOGIC OF #YOSOY132\nThe #YoSoy132 student movement played an integral role in mobilizing support for media reform. Sparked by a political snub at a private university, the movement amplified through social media, becoming a voice for media democratization. They underscored television networks as significant political entities and called for a change in the traditional media's overwhelming influence on democracy.\n\n#### THE RETURN OF THE PRI\nThe return of the PRI to the presidency, somewhat paradoxically, aligned with the aims of media reform. President Enrique Peña Nieto, despite his well-known ties with Televisa, was a driving force behind the 2013 telecommunications reform. This push for reform may have been an attempt to renew the PRI's image and uphold its legitimacy.\n\n#### THE MEXICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION\nAMEDI has consistently challenged the status quo regarding media policy and regulation. By bringing together diverse voices, including politicians, academics, and activists, AMEDI has created a platform to advocate for media plurality, challenging the collusion between media companies and the political class that had prevailed for years.\n\n#### SOME AMEDI STRATEGIES\nAMEDI's commitment to advocacy, oversight of lawmakers and civil servants, strategic litigation, and research have been pivotal in its success. These strategies not only facilitated change in the telecom law but also kept citizens informed. AMEDI's strategies demonstrate the necessity of an active, informed, and strategic civil society in influencing government and media relationships.\n\n#### CONCLUSION\nThe reforms in Mexican telecommunications are a testament to the power of consistent and organized civil advocacy, particularly by AMEDI. While challenges remain—such as the possible counter-reforms by media corporations—the 2013 telecommunications reform represents a critical shift towards accountability and greater civic influence in media regulation that may reshape the future of Mexican democracy."

For example, there is a need to strike a balance between devising solutions and develop- ing ideas, and between building consensus and protecting core principles. Above all, we advocate engagement with hegemonic media and policy-making institutions as public platforms, but resistance to the terms and deﬁnitions of policy problems imposed by media and political elites, and to the “logic” of dominant media narra- tives that serve to reinforce communication power. This approach recognizes that even amidst unprecedented, critical junctures in media policy, the political and media establishment is unlikely to reform itself in a substantive, meaningful, or long-lasting way. But critical junctures can oﬀer unparalleled opportunities for media activists and reformers to get their messages out, particularly on occasions when the mainstream media are compelled to cover issues ordinarily shunned from the agenda. Equally, however, we should not lose sight of the reality that hegemonic institutions can distort public debate and they should not be relied upon exclusively as vehicles of outreach. Ultimately, we believe that media reform groups must embrace media activism while avoiding totalizing perspectives that see any kind of engagement with hegemonic institutions as intrinsically counter-productive.\n\nThe notion of critical junctures has been used by sociologists to explain the windows of opportunities for social change oﬀered at speciﬁc times in his-\n\ntory. In the United Kingdom, Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into the ethics and practices of the press announced in 2011 was certainly represented as an important juncture that media reform groups sought to capitalize on. The phone hacking scandal made the news media themselves a headline story to a degree unparalleled in recent times, and the inquiry—as well as subsequent criminal trials—promised to sustain the spotlight.\nThis engendered unique opportunities as well as challenges for media reform movements that we will reﬂect on in this chapter. We will use the Media Reform Coalition (MRC) in the United Kingdom as a case study to elucidate the discursive struggles that tend to foreshadow media activism.  Indeed, it is within the sphere of media policy-making that the actions of the MRC were concentrated and where its successes and failures to date can be duly (if some- what preemptively) assessed.\nFirst, we will summarize the brief history of the MRC’s formation, actions and challenges. Second, we will theoretically problematize and deﬁne the domain of media policy-making in which the MRC had to operate. Third, we will conceptualize the struggle of the MRC beyond traditional framings of media reforms (Napoli 2007) by linking them to wider battles for social justice and social inclusion. Contemporaneous to events reﬂected on here, the Occupy movement was critiqued for eschewing engagement with existing political institutions and structures, and evading concrete policy solutions to the prob- lem of concentrated wealth (Roberts 2012). In respect of concentrated media power, there has been no such lack of engagement or deﬁned proposals for change on the part of media reform groups. But media activism in the United Kingdom and elsewhere has suﬀered from a lack of congruence in ideas and the kind of grassroots identity of resistance that enabled the Occupy movement to make a meaningful challenge to dominant discursive frameworks around inequality (Juris and Razsa 2012).\nUltimately, we argue that strategies of engagement and resistance should not be seen as mutually exclusive in media reform movements; that there is a par- ticular need to reclaim the notion of resistance in the context of concentrated media power from its cooption by neoliberal discourse around press freedom; and that critical media scholars, journalists, and activists have an integral role to play in documenting media failure and imbalances in the coverage of social justice issues at large, as a vehicle for wider social movement integration.\n\nFOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE MR C\nThe MRC was founded by media academics at Goldsmiths, University of London during summer 2011. Organizational goals were ﬁxed around the concept of a coordinating committee intended to mobilize and build consen- sus among civil society groups, academics, and activists in the context of the phone-hacking crisis. From the outset, the focus was on policy engagement\n \nand coordinating civil society responses to the myriad public inquiries that were set to follow.\nThese founding goals endowed the MRC with certain unique characteristics as a reform organization from the outset. First, it began from a set of broad principles rather than its own explicit manifesto for change or policy reform proposals. Media reform advocacy groups were already well-established in the United King- dom, including the Media Standards Trust, Media Wise, the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, and the more recently formed Hacked Oﬀ (backed by and representing the victims of phone hacking).\nThere seemed little point in adding another voice to this mix. Rather, the vision from the outset was to engender some semblance of an alliance that could overcome the fractures that media policy issues provoke within progres- sive politics. For instance, as has been demonstrated in the North American context (Hackett and Carroll 2006b), media activism in the United Kingdom is typically split between a focus on engagement with hegemonic institutions (seeking to inﬂuence the practices and output of professional media groups and advocating for reform at the policy level) and an oppositional resistance toward them (fostering independent “third sector” media and developing audi- ence frameworks for mainstream media criticism).\nIn regards to the Leveson Inquiry, the latter position was articulated strongly by investigative journalist and radical media critic John Pilger (2012) who regarded it from the outset as a show trial ultimately directed toward “the pres- ervation of the system.” Such comments were typical of critiques emanating from the radical Left and implied that engagement would merely confer legiti- macy on a process that was structurally rigged in favor of established media interests.\nBut this view was countered by Des Freedman, among others, who argued that to dismiss the signiﬁcance of the hearings all together was to ignore “the possibility that the exposure of media power during the course of the Inquiry might help to radicalise victims’ groups and other media reform campaigners.” This, in turn, could lay the basis “for a more sustained challenge to the hege- mony of corporate media” (Freedman 2014, 66–67).\nThis latter position, adopted by MRC from the outset, was not based on a naïve faith in the eﬃcacy of the process. It was based rather on a conviction that Leveson marked a rupture in the dominant discourses that have long served to legitimize the status quo of media policy and regulatory frameworks. As such, the hearings presented two unique opportunities for media reform activism in the United Kingdom. First, they provided unprecedented levels of disclosure in regards to the mechanics of media power which could fuel reform campaigns and activist research in a wide range of contexts. Second, they oﬀered a platform for the expression of alternative—even radical—views about the ownership, structure and regulation of the press which, however marginal-\n \nized from the coverage of Leveson itself, oﬀered a rare opportunity for such views to be heard outside the usual conﬁnes of media activist circles.\nNo matter how ﬂeeting and ephemeral, the MRC’s founding philosophy was based on a perceived need to exploit such opportunity, ultimately in a bid to help energize and sustain media reform activism in Britain. In a tone remi- niscent of Chomsky’s (1967) thesis on the “responsibility of intellectuals,” Freedman (2014, 67) argued that “the left has a responsibility in this context to amplify these arguments about the ﬂaws of an entrenched media power as part of a broader argument about the operation of the capitalist state.”\nBut there was another aspect to Pilger’s critique which did share common ground with the intellectual foundations of the MRC. This was the view that Leveson’s focus on the ethics and practices of the press did not come close to capturing the scope of structural problems impacting on media performance. Though the MRC’s position was not to dismiss the signiﬁcance of press regula- tory reform and the demands of phone-hacking victims, it did share with more radical critiques a conviction that these were insuﬃcient conditions for mean- ingful change. In particular, so long as media ownership issues were consigned to the margins, Leveson would fall prey to the relatively narrow terms of debate set by the mainstream press. Even within this framework, gaps and omissions skewed the press coverage in ways that undermined the voice of victims. But they also lent further weight to demands for more root-and-branch reform that extended beyond the complaints handling system of the press (Bennett and Townend 2012).\nThis holistic approach was reﬂected in the MRC’s initial three working groups covering media ethics, plurality, and funding. Although the latter two were subsequently merged, the output of the working groups reﬂected an on- going focus on plurality and ownership issues as fundamental rather than tan- gential to the campaign.\n\nNECESSARY TENSIONS \nWith a strong emphasis on inclusivity, it was inevitable that tensions in the campaign would emerge. They surfaced most acutely in the areas of policy deliberation, campaign strategies and internal governance. With regards to the ﬁrst, the MRC had to negotiate political and ideological fault lines extend- ing beyond that between engagement and resistance outlined above. In the UK context, media reform activism has long been structured around positions that either endorse public service media as an engine of the public sphere and counter-weight to concentrated private media power (Curran 2002; Garnham 1986; Scannell 1989) or perceive all corporate media (both public and private) as inherent threats to the independent performance of journalism (Keane 1991).\n \nFrom the beginning then, the MRC straddled the intersect of conﬂicting realms of discourse even within “friendly” stables. But this was not so much a weakness as its raison d’etre: consensus building was perceived as an essential component of its strategy to exploit the apparent gap that had been opened in the media policy paradigm. A united front seemed the only way to at least oﬀer a challenge to the dominant narratives of the press, which were rapidly closing ranks around a position of cosmetic rather than substantive reform.\nEarly casualties highlighted the diﬃculties of this task. The Voice of the Listener and Viewer, an advocacy group representing the consumer and citizen interest in public broadcasting, pulled out at the ﬁrst hurdle citing concerns that initial policy proposals were not suﬃciently explicit in regards to protect- ing the scope and funding of the BBC. At the other end of the scale, attempts to engage with press freedom groups bore little fruit given their resistance to any suggestion of state involvement in the regulation of the press.\nPart of the challenge was an intellectual one. In order to engage key stake- holders such as the National Union of Journalists and Hacked Oﬀ, the MRC had to ﬁnd a way to speak in support of both journalists and the victims of phone hacking. Indeed, such a holistic voice seemed to be precisely what was missing from the media reform landscape at large. This further sharpened the focus on media owners as the ultimate bearers of responsibility not only for ethical misconduct in their newsrooms, but also the erosion of journalist autonomy that was a crucial (although less talked about) backdrop to the scandal.\nEngagement with stakeholders also gave rise to tensions in governance. On the one hand, an initial steering committee had to be all but abandoned due to a failure to sustain the active involvement of group representatives in the pro- duction of collaborative evidence. On the other hand, individuals who did maintain a close involvement expressed concern over what was perceived as a retreat from collaboration by the MRC’s Goldsmiths-based organizers.\nTensions derived in part from the MRC’s founding ambition to play a coor- dinating role among existing civil society groups rather than create an academic think tank. But those groups had distinct priorities, agendas and ways of operating ranging from grassroots member-driven organizations like Avaaz to issue-speciﬁc advocacy groups like Hacked Oﬀ. As such, each group was understandably conscious of the need to ensure that its own voice was heard above the pulpit and that eﬀective representation of its constituents was not diluted by allegiance to a somewhat abstracted coalition. In this regard, any media reform alliance faces a much steeper challenge in outreach compared to single-issue campaigns such as the Stop the War Coalition.\nUnderlying all of this was the question of representation, which became explicit by the time the MRC founding principles had developed into concrete proposals for reform. Although very much the product of collaborative research and deliberation, the proposals inevitably gave the MRC a distinct organiza-\n \ntional identity that in some ways conﬂicted with its founding principles. Clearly, there would have been little sense in simply collating and representing the views and perspectives of various civil society groups. A core rationale behind the very notion of a coordinating committee was not just to identify common ground among reform groups, but to push for deliberation on a host of emergent issues around which many groups had yet to adopt a deﬁnitive position. Contentious questions regarding the framework of media regulatory reform included whether membership of a new press complaints group should be mandatory or voluntary; whether a comprehensive system of ﬁxed media ownership limits should be imposed within key news markets; and how new sources of public funding for the media should be sourced and allocated. Strik- ing the right balance between advocating concrete proposals for reform while leaving room for consensus building proved to be a key strategic challenge.\nStrategic challenges were also related to practical considerations of how best to prioritize and allocate the organization’s minimal resources. On the one hand, public engagement as well as media strategies seemed to be an essential compo- nent of any broad-based coalition for reform. But MRC organizers lacked the funds and network building blocks to make signiﬁcant in-roads into the public consciousness on their own accord. Added to this was a virtual impasse in regards to achieving even neutral press coverage.\nIn this respect, it is signiﬁcant that MRC’s most high proﬁle event to date, a celebrity-fronted public rally in May 2012, received virtually no contemporane- ous press coverage. Yet nearly a year later, the event was described in detail by Andrew Gilligan in a piece for the Daily Telegraph in which he attempted to portray Leveson’s modest recommendations for press regulatory reform as the outcome of a left-wing conspiracy. Somewhat ironically, the fact that the MRC “received virtually no publicity in the mainstream media” was used to invoke this sense of conspiracy (Gilligan 2013).\n\nDEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE \nBy the fourth module of the Leveson hearings (addressing policy solutions), deliberation had given way to advocacy as the central thrust of the MRC’s work, though a strong instinct for collaboration and consensus building con- tinued to drive the organization’s advocacy eﬀorts.\nIt was at this point that a fully mobilized mainstream press began a relentless eﬀort to discredit civil society reform proposals. But in spite of this, the MRC and its partner organizations succeeded in reframing policy debates and the Leveson recommendations—at least in respect of the press complaints system— bore the hallmarks of a civil society as well as subsequent cross-party consensus. For a brief moment, what had eluded all of Leveson’s long line of predecessors began to look like a realistic possibility: a system of self-regulation of the press with broad representation, statutory underpinning, in-built protections for\n \njournalist autonomy, and meaningful powers of sanction and enforcement (Leveson 2012).\nAlthough the press lobby succeeded in deterring Parliament from legislating, the Hacked Oﬀ lobby managed to pull oﬀ a cross-party deal on a royal charter that embodied the bulk of Leveson’s recommendations. What’s more, the royal charter was to be uniquely entrenched to the extent that ministers would be unable to alter it without Parliamentary approval, eﬀectively giving it the same status as legal statute.\nA rival charter proposal backed by a majority of the press endorsed ministe- rial discretion over parliamentary oversight. This seemed to lay bare the hollow rhetoric of libertarian deﬁance that had dominated the opinion editorial pages for months. In any case, the cross-party charter won out and was approved by the Privy Council in the autumn of 2013.\nPerhaps in an attempt to hedge his bets, Leveson opted not to address the ownership and plurality question in a substantive way, despite the inquiry’s unprecedented disclosures of excessive intimacy and institutional corruption between media and political elites. But buoyed by the success of the cross-party agreement, the Labour party front bench began to pick up and run with owner- ship reform proposals. Shadow culture secretary and deputy Labour leader Har- riet Harman spoke of ownership concentration as having fostered “a culture of invincibility” among dominant media and that “it’s wrong for democracy for there to be a lack of plurality in newspapers.”\nBut red lines on reform began to be drawn almost as soon as the prospect of real change glimmered on the horizon. For a political establishment still gripped in the discursive throes of austerity, funding solutions were a policy nonstarter. And in a matter of months, the gap had narrowed further as caps rapidly became a dirty word and even discussion of ownership became all but displaced by the less eﬀacing issue of plurality.\nAt the same time, the royal charter began to look like a hollow victory as newspapers collectively opted out and pressed ahead with their own plans for a new complaints-handling body. By the close of 2013, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) had emerged as the favorite to replace the discredited Press Complaints Commission. Newspapers seemed content with the threat of exemplary damages if complaints could not be resolved by IPSO, which would not be recognized under the terms of the royal charter.\nWithin a matter of months then, what had looked like unprecedented achievement by media reform groups appeared to unravel into something more like spectacular failure. But it is perhaps too early to draw meaningful lessons. Much of the historical impetus for the MRC derives from the Channel 4 legacy: it took the best part of three decades to reach a political compromise over Britain’s third public broadcaster in 1982. But it nevertheless resulted in a com- paratively radical mandate to represent minority interests and to cover political\n \nissues in-depth without impartiality constraints within particular programs (Curran and Seaton 2009).\nThe battle over Channel 4, however, was not equivalent to the struggle for a democratic and accountable media system and the fundamental reform that would entail. In this context, the word reform seems inappropriately modest when matched against an end-goal that demands a root-and-branch overhaul of media policy and regulatory frameworks.\n\nUNDERSTANDING MEDIA POLICY MAKING AS ORDER OF DISCOURSE \nBecause the MRC had to function and operate predominantly within the domain of policy-making (given inadequate resources to support substantive public engagement campaigns), it is useful to ponder over the meaning of policy and its relevance for the struggle of media reforms.\nThe literature tends to understand policy and policy making in diﬀerent ways (Colebatch 2002; Ham and Hill 1993). For some, policy is “what govern- ments do, why they do it, and what diﬀerence it makes” (Dye 1976, 1). How- ever, governments are not the only bodies that produce policy, and there are also policies developed by independent regulatory bodies, public institutions, and trade organizations (Galperin 2004). A common model applied to the study of policy is the “cycle model” (Colebatch 2002, 55) that sees policy- making as a sequence of stages: “agenda setting (problem recognition), policy formulation (proposal of a solution), decision-making (choice of a solution), policy implementation (delivery), and policy evaluation (checking the results)” (Howlett and Ramesh 2003, 10).\nOf course, in reality, the policy-making process is more convoluted than the cycle model assumes. Stages may not follow the predicted order or may be omitted.\nA particularly fruitful line of thought aimed at analyzing policy-making and which has attracted considerable attention in the study of media reforms (Napoli 2007) has been the “interest group approach to policy” that explains policy as “the outcome of competing powerful interest groups” preferences that can span from NGOs to trade union organizations to business organizations and so on. As Galperin (2004, 160) explains: “Policy outcomes are typically explicated by the organization and the resources available to interest groups and their support coalitions. In other words, policy outcomes are a function of the power that each interest group is able to amass and wield in support of its pre- ferred outcome.”\nHowever, this conﬁguration shares with the cycle model approach a ten- dency to overlook the complexities built into the policy-making process and neglects an analysis of social and cultural power at play. Policy outcome\n \nbecomes the result of a predictable war between competing groups with diﬀer- ent goals, thus ignoring that “much political activity is concerned with main- taining the status quo and resisting challenges to the existing allocation of values” (Ham and Hill 1993, 12).\nFor this reason, the work of Michel Foucault on governmentality and dis- course (1981 [1970], 1991) might facilitate a better understanding of the realm of policy-making and provide fruitful observations for activists seeking to build strong and successful reform movements. Foucault’s work on governmentality draws on the belief that “the how of power is as important as who has the power” (1991, 103). Foucault’s study on the production of discourse is also par- ticularly useful in that it problematizes the practices of government and how public policy is developed, shaped, and changed. According to this thesis, rela- tions of power “permeate, characterise and constitute the social body, and these relations of power cannot themselves be established, consolidated nor imple- mented without the production, accumulation, circulation and functioning of a discourse” (1980, 93).\nIn “The Order of Discourse” (1981 [1970]), Foucault investigates the social practices of disciplines and shows how discourses are embedded in social prac- tices (and disciplines) through rituals, values, and routines. Foucault’s ideas are extremely valuable in an analysis of policy-making, because they challenge the belief that media policy is a rational process. On the contrary, Foucault warns that the rules of government are not themselves deﬁned by the rule of law, but rather by the rules of knowledge, power, and discourse formation. So what is presented to us as incontrovertible truth or evidence in policy-making is rather the product of “the will to truth”: “Thus all that appears to our eyes is a truth conceived as a richness, a fecundity, a gentle and insidiously universal force, and in contrast we are unaware of the will to truth, that prodigious machinery designed to exclude” (ibid., 56).\nDrawing on Foucault, the work of Norman Fairclough (1989) is extremely helpful in highlighting the strategic importance of an “order of discourse” that embodies speciﬁc ideologies in policy: “Since discourse is the favored vehicle of ideology, and therefore of control by consent, it may be that we should expect a quantitative change in the role of discourse in achieving social control” (ibid., 37). Thus, policy becomes not the product of policy-making institutions but rather an order of discourse structuring what can and cannot be said as well as who has the power to speak. But as Gramsci (1996) has argued, social control in modern complex societies is not exerted through coercion but through con- sent, therefore the ideologies conveyed through discourse are not imposed, but simply accepted.\nDrawing on this approach, the order of discourse that the coalition had to challenge becomes apparent: on the one hand, the hegemonic mantra of mar- ket liberalism, on the other hand, the cultural background of an established commercial media system.\n \nFor example, a dominant discourse of market liberals’ policy-makers might interpret media democratization as deregulation (Hackett and Carroll 2006a), while a change of media systems might seem unthinkable because it becomes detrimental to a freedom of speech argument, especially in the United States where it is often evoked as the principle upholding liberal individualism.\nThis can explain, for example, why in policy discourse in (and beyond) the United Kingdom, there is a common belief that regulation of media ownership should not be a priority for policy-makers but rather that plurality as an instru- ment of market competition should be the main concern. Indeed, plurality is becoming an increasingly popular term of reference for policy-makers develop- ing reforms in the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australia.\n\nFR OM MEDIA REFORMS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE \nSo how then can a dominant policy discourse be transformed by a media activist campaign and an order of discourse be subverted? What are the tools? And what is then the role of activist groups? For years, as Napoli (2007, 21) rightly argues, early work on media reform lacked a solid theoretical perspective, while the focus seemed to be consistently “legalistic.” When later studies embraced diﬀerent frameworks, they seemed to adhere to interest group theories of policy-making discussed above. More recently however, scholarship has found more fruitful ground through conceptualizing the battles of groups advocating media reforms as the actions of an emerging social movement (Atton 2003; Calabrese 2004; Hackett and Carroll 2006a).\nHackett and Carroll (2006a) elaborated a thorough sketch of the most important frames employed by scholarship to understand media reform move- ments. Out of the main frames, perhaps one of the less developed is the idea of media reform as “a ﬁrst issue that can draw new people into public life, citizen activism, and wider struggles for social justice” (Jansen 2011, 7). Indeed, accord- ing to McChesney (2007, 220), “fates of media reform and social justice research are intertwined. They will rise or fall together.” Jensen (2011, 2) also notes that Amartya Sen’s (2009) theory of justice dovetails with McChesney’s perspective, as “the removal of barriers to free and open discussion, the devel- opment of the right (‘capability’) to communicate, and the institutionalization of an ‘unrestrained and healthy media’ (to give ‘voice to the neglected and dis- advantaged’)” becomes fundamental “to the pursuit of human justice and security.”\nAccording to Mouﬀe (1999, 756), “every consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power and that always entails some form of exclusion.” If hegemony is provisional, then media reform movements should concentrate on building a permanent campaign far beyond a single-issue crusade. Given that it took thirty years to introduce and develop a successful policy discourse to launch Britain’s third public broadcaster, Channel\n \n4, in 1982, a more overreaching media reform campaign would need to create a wider base, a consistent message, and a long-term agenda.\nIf we consider that the key challenge for any media reform movement lies not so much in building consensus among existing stakeholders, but in articu- lating a narrative that can resonate with wider struggles for social justice, then the MRC experience oﬀers some useful lessons. First, it seems clear that the organization was somewhat constrained by a degree of unavoidable short- termism in its outlook and approach. To understand why this was the case, we need to recall the peculiar circumstances and political context into which it was born. It was the prospect of a public inquiry into the media with a remit unprecedented in scope which provided the impetus for the founding of the MRC in 2011. It was also the basis on which it secured limited short-term funding from the Open Society Foundations with the explicit objective of coordinating civil society responses to the inquiry. Along with these speciﬁci- ties enshrined in the MRC’s founding agenda and funding terms, the scope for action was further constrained by the imminent time pressures imposed by the various deadlines for submission of evidence to the Leveson and concomitant inquiries.\nThis also contributed to situating the MRC ﬁrmly within the policymaking community. It was a position that was further anchored by the MRC’s collabo- ration with Hacked Oﬀ, an organization with an explicit lobbying focus. As we have seen, this provided the MRC, for a brief moment at least, with an oppor- tunity to intervene and to some extent reframe media policy debates. But it also constrained the organization to the extent that the press had an incompa- rably more fundamental role in deﬁning and circumscribing the terms of that debate. Thus the notion of press freedom was always exclusively tied to the threat of statutory underpinning of press regulation. Media reform groups were forced to articulate defenses on the basis that statutory underpinning would not threaten press freedom, with little room to demonstrate the real threat to press freedom posed by ownership.\nMaintaining such a close proximity to the heart of the policymaking com- munity also limited the MRC’s capacity to reach out to groups that were not already engaged in media policy debates but might nevertheless align with a progressive agenda for media reform. As already mentioned, the MRC was constrained in this respect also by its limited resources. But one resource in plentiful supply was its capacity to present new evidence of media failure through critical scholarship, new studies and new data. By tying this critical scholarship directly to the concerns of other social justice movements, media reform groups can provide a basis for wider engagement and thus a more assured footing in their resistance to dominant neoliberal discursive frameworks. As Hackett and Carroll (2004, 18) succinctly observe: “This frame repositions the project as one of social justice in a world organized around global capitalism,\n \nracism and patriarchy, and directly connotes the need for alliances, even integra- tion, with other social movements.”\nOf course, this is not a new idea. There are plenty of historical precedents demonstrating success in linking media reform with other social movements. For example, Horwitz (1997, 344) explains that the success of US media reforms movements of the 1970s was due to a “connection to the broader social move- ment of Civil Rights.” The key challenge is to think of how to build these connections in the contemporary socio-political landscape and how best to link media reform movements to campaigns such as climate change activism, with a view to making fair, accountable and accurate coverage of climate change issues a key concern of campaigning groups. This would in turn draw meaningful support for media reform from a wider layer of other groups. We could perhaps also draw lessons from the way in which climate change activism has evolved into a movement for climate justice, encompassing a network of organizations committed to social, gender as well as ecological iniquities.\n\nCONCL USION \nA stronger discursive focus on resistance might also make it easier for media activist and advocacy movements to engage a broader spectrum of groups already active in their struggles against poverty, racial and gender discrimina- tion, ecological risks, and violations of human rights; to foster and build soli- darity across diﬀerent social justice movements in an eﬀort to change and reshape dominant media policy discourses. Most importantly, a focus on resistance poses a direct challenge to the dominant discursive order that deﬁnes resistance exclusively in the context of the threat of state interference and the struggle to safeguard press freedom (or more accurately, press power).\nSuch a focus need not necessitate disengagement from the media policy process or from established stakeholders, provided that the target of resistance is framed clearly and exclusively as media owners who use their assets in a bid to control the political and public agenda. Such a platform could even be used to further engage with professional journalists themselves with a view to redressing the balance of power between capital and labor within newsrooms (Sparks 2007).\nResistance to corporate media ownership also provides a basis upon which to articulate a struggle that transcends the boundaries between diﬀerent national contexts. On one level, creeping state control of the media in, for example, Hungary over recent years looks a world apart from the UK context. But at root in both cases is a strengthening alliance between media and political elites. Whether that alliance is founded on favored media outlets or compliant political actors merely reﬂects two faces of the same problem: the reassertion of control over public conversations.\n \nUltimately, the split that Carroll and Hackett (2006b) identiﬁed between media activist groups that focus on engagement with hegemonic institutions and those that adopt an oppositional resistance toward them need not reﬂect a choice that has to—or indeed should be—made. Though it may take some time, media activist groups that are embedded in broad-based and grassroots movements for social change stand a better chance of mounting a meaningful challenge to the dominant neoliberal frameworks that overarch media policy debates. Those frameworks co-opt notions of resistance and autonomy in ways that obscure the real and fundamental threat to press freedom in the United Kingdom and other Western democracies: concentrated media power.\n"

      "content": "### CHAPTER ELEVEN: Between Philosophy and Action: The Story of the Media Reform Coalition\n#### By Benedetta Brevini, University of Sydney, Australia & Justin Schlosberg, Birkbeck, University of London, United Kingdom\n\n#### MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY\nThe Media Reform Coalition (MRC) in the United Kingdom operates on the intersection of engagement with hegemonic media and resistance against the narratives imposed by media and political elites. The MRC encourages taking advantage of critical junctures, like the Leveson Inquiry, to promote media reform messages but acknowledges that hegemonic institutions can distort public debate.\n\n#### FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE MRC\nFormed during the UK's phone-hacking crisis in 2011, the MRC aimed to build consensus among civil society groups, academics, and activists. Instead of presenting its own manifesto, it focused on policy engagement and supporting civil society responses to media inquiries, while not avoiding actions that could be perceived as radical or fundamental.\n\n#### NECESSARY TENSIONS\nThe MRC had to navigate tensions within its ranks, dealing with different perspectives on media reform, from those advocating for public service media to radical voices that distrust all corporate media. Balancing concrete proposals and broad consensus while allocating limited resources proved to be strategically challenging, and gaining press coverage was difficult.\n\n#### DEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE\nDespite limited resources and short-term funding, the MRC managed to influence public inquiry discussions and the framing of media policy debates. The cross-party royal charter, an outcome of the Leveson Inquiry, was considered a victory for media reform but faced the challenge of being adopted by the press industry.\n\n#### UNDERSTANDING MEDIA POLICY-MAKING AS ORDER OF DISCOURSE\nMedia policy is often governed by discourse and ideology rather than transparent legal frameworks. Neoliberal discourses emphasizing market liberalism and press freedom often overshadow the need for media democratization and ownership regulation.\n\n#### FROM MEDIA REFORMS TO SOCIAL JUSTICE\nMedia reform should be integrated into broader social justice movements. Like the climate change activism that evolved into a movement for climate justice, media reform can benefit from solidarity with groups fighting against various social iniquities.\n\n#### CONCLUSION\nEffective media reform necessitates both engagement with and resistance against concentrated media power. Joining forces with diverse social justice movements may help reframe the resistance against media policy controlled by media moguls and political elites. A focus on concentrated media ownership can unite efforts nationally and internationally, ultimately confronting dominant neoliberal policies that impede genuine press freedom."

The strategies they utilized are context-sensitive and mostly eﬀective in terms of raising public awareness, setting public agendas and having an impact upon government decisions and policies concerning media freedom and media democratization. These strategies include, among others, engaging in public debates, lobbying the legislature, and, where necessary, mobilizing public support in both online and oﬄine protests. However, these strategies have limitations too. Most of all, the mainstream media were usu- ally hostile to media reform movements and the government was passive in its response to the cause of media reform. To overcome this extremely diﬃcult situa- tion, media activists in Taiwan have taken advantage of new media and social media to pursue their media reform goals and have increasingly engaged in creat- ing more diverse information alternatives to the mainstream media.\n\nIn recent years, Taiwan has been ranked as one of the top countries in terms of press freedom in Asia (Freedom House 2014). This is remarkable given that the country was still ruled by an authoritarian, one-party regime less than three decades ago. Until 1987, the martial law, which aimed to suppress the Com- munists in mainland China, was ﬁnally lifted and the press liberalized (AP\n\n153\n \n1987). Taiwanese citizens were allowed to form diﬀerent political parties. The political transition of democratization in the late 1980s put an end to the world’s longest period of rule under martial law (thirty-eight consecutive years) and the longstanding bans on organizing political parties and publishing new newspapers. From then onward, three waves of media reform movements aimed at media democratization started apace. Each wave of media reform pursued the same goals but utilized somewhat diﬀerent strategies.\nOver the last few decades, the interests of the ruling party usually com- manded civil society; the party opinions and interests usurped the public ones. Therefore, the ﬁrst wave of media reform movements in Taiwan called for media privatization and liberalization because the government maintained its monopoly over terrestrial television right up to 1997, when the ﬁrst privately owned terrestrial television station was launched in Taiwan. Yet, another eight years would pass before the government was forced to ﬁnally give up its owner- ship of the other three terrestrial television stations.\nHowever, the media privatization and liberalization that ran riot in the 1990s also caused new problems. Private media in pursuit of commercial interests could not manage the responsibility of handling the public service and the public sphere. The big media consolidation, thanks to a series of mergers, had resulted in “market-driven journalism” (McManus 1994) or even “audience ratings journalism” (Lin 2009). The second wave of move- ments for media reform in Taiwan thus strived to campaign against big media and irresponsible journalism prevailed in the market. Since the late 1990s, established by nonpartisan media activists, the Media Watch Foundation has done a great deal to promote media literacy education and ﬁght media com- mercialism.\nThe third wave of media reform movements has entered new terrain. Since 2003, media activists and media scholars have formed the Campaign for Media Reform with the intent to pursue new goals. This new movement seeks to expand public media that correspond more closely to the ideal of public service broadcasting in terms of quality, universality, independence, and diversity and strengthen alternative, independent citizen media.\nIn this chapter, we focus on how media reform groups in Taiwan engaged in the aforementioned media reform movements and the strategies utilized by these groups. We begin by providing a brief account of media history and the changing media landscape in Taiwan. Next, we discuss the media reform movements in Taiwan and the strategies media reform activists utilized respec- tively in the campaign for the expansion of public media and the campaign against big media mergers. We also examine the increasing relevance of the alternative, independent citizen media in Taiwan’s media reform movements. Our discussion concludes with the future prospects for media reform move- ments in Taiwan.\n \nTHE CHANGING MEDIA L ANDSCAP E IN TAIWAN \n\nTaiwan is a small island country with a population of twenty-three million. Before 1987, because of the martial law, the broadcast media in Taiwan were mainly owned and controlled by the ruling Nationalist Party, the government, and the military. Most of the newspapers were in the hands of those who were close and loyal to the authoritarian regime.\nWith the abolition of the martial law, the ban on publishing new newspa- pers was lifted and newspapers were liberalized. In 1993, cable systems were legalized. The media industry started to grow rapidly. By 2015, there were 4 main daily newspapers, 171 radio stations, 5 terrestrial broadcasters, 57 cable systems, 5 multiple-system operators (MSOs), and 294 satellite TV channels. About 59.6 percent of households subscribed to cable TV (NCC 2015).\nHowever, the huge number of media outlets did not guarantee a free market- place of ideas. The ﬁerce competitive market did not bring quality news to the Taiwanese people. Since 2003, tabloid journalism and sensational news has become inﬂuential in the media industry. Sensational news was commonly seen on TV and in newspapers. With the inﬂuences of media commercialism, profes- sional journalism came to be at risk. The threat of big media consolidation and the inﬂuence of political power still remained severe to media freedom and the freedom of speech in Taiwan. Therefore, the need for media reform became more and more urgent. Since 1987, there have been three main media reform waves in Taiwan.\n\nMEDIA REFORM MO VEMENT S IN TAIWAN \nThese three waves of media reform movements can be categorized as: (1) media privatization and liberalization starting in 1987; (2) the campaign for expand- ing public media starting in 2003; and (3) the ﬁght over big media mergers in recent years.\n\nm EDIA pRIvATIzATION AND LIBERALIzATION \nSimilar to the United States, the 1980s can also be characterized by many major political and societal changes (Mueller 2004). In 1987, the government abashed the martial law and Taiwan started its ﬁrst step out from authorized govern- ment toward a more democratized country (Ministry of Culture 2011). How- ever, despite the lifting of the martial law, Taiwanese society and media still had a long way to go before it could be considered fully democratic.\nThe ﬁght for freedom speech happened at the same time as many social activists were still ﬁghting for basic democratic rights in Taiwan. For instance, at that time, advocating for an independent Taiwan was still prohibited by the\n \ngovernment. Right after the lifting of martial law, many social activists ﬁghting for freedom of speech were organizing protests and strikes. A notable dissident, Nylon Cheng, even sacriﬁced his life in 1989 to ﬁght the erstwhile authoritar- ian state in an attempt to awaken Taiwanese society.\nIn line with ﬁghting for a democratic society and media, the push for media privatization and liberalization led to the ﬁrst wave of media reform in Taiwan. An association formed by scholars and social groups argued for “no political parties, government, or military ownership of the three broadcasters.” A big protest for media privatization and liberalization took place in 1995 in the capital city Taipei despite concerns about the power of big ﬁnancial consolida- tion (Kuang 2004). The protest successfully led to the establishment of a new law regarding the sale of government-owned stocks of the broadcasters in order to privatize and liberalize them.\nA series of media privatizations and liberalizations occurred in the 1990s. In 1993, cable systems were liberalized, and the government-owned telephone company was privatized in 1996. Between 1993 and 1998, there were limited foreign investments on the media in Taiwan. After the Cable Radio and Televi- sion Act was modiﬁed in 1999, foreign investments increased substantially. Three major MSOs were owned by big global media players after 2007 (Huang 2009). These major changes did not come out of nowhere: Comments made by scholars and social movements on the streets all contributed to the develop- ment of media privatization and liberalization. The experiences learned from other regulators in the world also contributed to the changes. In hindsight, the seemingly inevitable trend of media privatization and liberalization since the 1990s has catered for the interests of foreign private equity while foreign own- ers of the MSOs did not in return invest signiﬁcantly in the production of local content. Instead, the foreign owners of the MSOs were seeking arbitrage prof- its. As a result, the trend of privatization and liberalization since the 1990s exacerbated the already serious lack of quality and diversity in terms of media content available to local audiences.\n\nStrategies Utilized\nAccording to Mueller (2004), there are three kinds of advocacy modes in infor- mation and communication policies: content, economic, and rights. Content is related to the problems of media messages; economic advocacy is about the supply of communication products and services; rights advocacy concerns individual rights, such as freedom of expression or property rights. At this stage, advocates asserted the rights of communication, including communica- tion rights for public and media workers. Freedom of expression and anticen- sorship rights were the central arguments advanced by social movement activists in Taiwan during the ﬁrst wave of media reforms.\nHackett and Carroll (2006) indicate ﬁve action frames for remaking media: Free press, cultural environment, media democratization, the right to com-\n \nmunicate, and media justice. At the time, Taiwanese society was still in the process of ﬁghting for a free press, the right to communicate, and media democratization. Political and social activists conducted protests and estab- lished new alternative magazines.\n\nTHE CAmpAIGN FOR EXpANDING p UBLIC mEDIA \nMedia liberalization and privatization in the 1990s did not bear fruit in terms of media democratization in the public interest. The mainstream commercial media in pursuit of ratings and advertising revenues at the expense of news credibility gradually lost the public’s trust. It is no surprise that, according to an Edelman Asia-Paciﬁc survey, Taiwanese broadcasters are ranked by viewers as being the least trusted in Asia (Lo 2012a). Many foreign commentators have also observed that the irresponsible journalism prevailing in Taiwan has caused widespread public mistrust (Fuchs 2014; Harding 2010). For example, a writer for Foreign Policy recently criticized that “over the last decade, Taiwanese media have come to be known for in-your-face, no-holds-barred reporting that manages to be simultaneously sensationalist and mundane” (Fuchs 2014).\nThe worsening situation of media performance as a whole in the early 2000s gave impetus to a new movement for media reform in Taiwan. Two major media reform organizations were established: the Campaign for Media Reform and the Media Watch Foundation. The Campaign for Media Reform was established in 2003 by a group of scholars, news workers and social movement activists from the Democratization of Broadcasters Coalition. The campaign goal is to improve media performance and environment, educate the public about media literacy, and improve media policies in Taiwan. Since 2008, it has hosted three annual media reform meetings to invite the public to talk about media reform in Taiwan (Lo 2012b). The campaign has initiated many impor- tant media reform movements and press conferences to make the public aware of pressing social issues. The Media Watch Foundation was established in 2002. The organization’s goal is to protect the labor rights of media workers and to improve media literacy education for the public. The foundation also helped to form a public media mechanism, initiate many media reform movements, and monitor media performance and self-regulation in Taiwan. The foundation provided many training workshops at community colleges to help the public learn about media literacy and citizen journalism and has also supported youth programs in Taiwan. Both organizations have had a great inﬂuence on the major media reform movements in Taiwan over the last decade.\nThe establishment of public media—Public Television Station (PTS) and\nTaiwan Broadcasting Service (TBS)—is an important achievement for media reform movements in Taiwan. Aimed at serving the public interest and bal- ancing the inadequacy of commercial televisions, PTS started broadcasting in July 1998. Back in 2003, when media reformers and social movement activists\n \nfought for separating political power, government, and military inﬂuences from broadcasters, the urge for a public broadcasting system was widely dis- cussed. As a result, TBS was established in July 2006.\nSince the 1970s, communication scholars had argued the importance of constructing a public television service in Taiwan (Feng 2006). However, the public television conceived in the 1970s and the 1980s was more like a televi- sion that did not have commercials, dealt with programs for social education, and played the role of fulﬁlling government’s need for policies and education. In 1992, eighteen communication scholars at the National Cheng-Chi Univer- sity made a public comment criticizing the draft of the Public Television Act (PTA), focusing in particular on the formation of the board for PTS. In 1993, the Student Group for Observing the Public Television was established. Com- munication scholars collaborated with other scholars (e.g., economists, law- yers, and sociologists) and citizen groups to form a preparation group for the PTS. The movements for establishing a public broadcasting system were initi- ated by the Coalition for Establishing Public Media in 1997. However, on April 16, 1997, the major political party (KMT) announced that Taiwan would be giving up the establishment of public television. Scholars and others who cared about public media made their discontent with the decision known via public newspapers. The Association for the Establishment of Public Media, scholars, and students protested in front of the Legislative Yuan. Because of these com- ments and protests, the KMT decided not to give up on the act. The draft of the Public Television Act was ﬁnally approved by the Legislative Yuan.\nIn 1997, the Democratization of Broadcasters Coalition, which was the pre-\ndecessor of the Campaign for Media Reform (Kuo 2010), was established to plan the formation of a public television system in Taiwan. By 2014, four sta- tions were included in TBS. Moreover, public interest is the main principle for the maintenance of TBS which is owned by the public, instead of the govern- ment. However, the management of TBS is not straightforward. There have been countless arguments and debates concerning the nomination of the board members and the CEO of TBS. The need to have proper legislation rule for TBS is still an ongoing debate in Taiwan and has led t o many protests urging legislative reform.\n\nStrategies Utilized\nSimilar to the claims made by advocacy movements in the ﬁrst wave of media reform, this movement also asserted the rights of freedom of speech and com- munication: The right to public television, without interference by the govern- ment and the military during the second wave of media reform. In addition, they also were advocates for better content (Mueller 2004), a need that was not always covered by commercial media.\nThe main strategy used in establishing PTS was to form an agenda against government and military intervention, later forming positive arguments as to\n \nhow to establish PTS (Feng 2006). Media reform activists tried to emphasize the importance of free broadcasters and a real public television station (not a government-controlled station). The initial argument was proposed by scholars in communication departments and then extended to scholars in other ﬁelds. Trying to persuade the public and the government was critical. However, dur- ing these movements, the intellectuals initiated the discussions. Still, they could not persuade the government to accept the values they proposed (Feng 2006).\n\nTHE FIGHT OvER BIG m EDIA mERGERS \nFollowing the stream of media privatization, the legislative Yuan passed the National Communications Commission Organization Act in 2005. The act calls for the establishment of the National Communications Commission (NCC) to separate the inﬂuence of political parties, government, and military on the mass media.\nIn February 2006, the NCC was established to take charge of media regula- tion and related policy-making on telecommunications and broadcasting industries. Originally, the telecommunications industry was regulated by the Directorate General of Telecommunications and the broadcasting industries were regulated by the Department of Broadcasting Aﬀairs of the Government Information oﬃce. However, with the increase in media convergence, there was a need to have a central regulator to take charge of both telecommunica- tions and broadcasting industries.\nIn the age of media convergence, the issues of media concentration and media monopolies are more complicated and consolidation can be bigger and more inﬂuential. A media company can own multiple newspapers, online media, TV, radio, and cable systems. This makes companies even more power- ful and inﬂuential than if they only owned one media outlet (such as a news- paper), making antimedia monopoly movements even more important.\nSince 2006, several big mergers have been reviewed by the NCC, including the merger of BCC (radio) and CTV (TV) in 2006; the China Times (one of the four major newspapers) with two major TV news stations (CTV and CtiTV) in 2007; Taiwan Mobile with several cable systems in 2008; as well as Want Want China Broadcast’s proposed buyout of China Network Systems (Lo 2013). Among these cases, the establishment of Want Want China Media Corp. and the approval of its subsequent mergers have been the most debated topics in Taiwan.\n\nThe Want Want China Times Incidents\n\nWant Want Corp., originally a food product company, merged with one of the main newspapers (the China Times) and became a multiplatform media\n \ncorporation that owned two TV news stations and a newspaper company (Want Want China Times Media Group) in 2009. This incident was called “Want Want merges China Times, CTV and CtiTV,” also know as “Three Chung Incident.” The approval of the merger was accompanied by signiﬁcant debates. Nevertheless, the Want Want merger was approved by the NCC in 2008 and established Want Want China Times Corp in 2009.\nOwning two news stations and one newspaper did not satisfy the corpora- tion. In 2011, Want Want China Times Media Corp (Want Want) proposed to buy one of the main MSOs (CNS) in Taiwan. This merger (“Wang Chung Incident”) would allow the corporation to own twelve TV channels, eleven cable systems, one publisher, two magazines, three online media companies, four newspaper companies (including one major newspaper), and at least nine other investment companies (such as travel agency and production compa- nies). This would lead to a great monopoly in the media industry in Taiwan. The International Federation of Journalist (IFJ) also pointed out that the merger would allow Want Want to own about one-third of audiences and read- ers in the whole media industry. This caused great concern (Liberty Times 2012). Therefore, a series of media reform movements began to ﬁght this media monopoly. In February 2013, after about two and a half years’ investigation and debates, the NCC did not approve the merger proposal due to the public con- cern over the formation of a media monopoly (and the concentration of a marketplace of ideas).\n\nStrategies Utilized\nThe media reform movement used a variety of strategies to achieve its goal including public comments, exposure to media, protests, and allies.\nThe media reform movements against the Want Want merger started with a series of public remarks in traditional newspapers made by communication and journalism scholars in September, 2011. These scholars were also active members of the Campaign for Media Reform in Taiwan which also issued a public statement opposing the merger. After September 2011, a series of letters to newspapers, antimonopoly workshops, and public statements were made by scholars in diﬀerent ﬁelds and other media reform and social groups. For example, in September 2011, a workshop on cross-media concentration was held by the Institute of Journalism at National Taiwan University (NTU).\nOn October 24, 2011, the NCC held the ﬁrst public hearing on the merger of Want Want. At the same time, scholars and media reform groups (including Taiwan Media Watch, Citizen Congress Watch, the Association of Taiwan Journalists, and the Campaign for Media Reform) started an online protest via a campaign platform created by social movement groups (see http://campaign\n.tw-npo.org/index2.php). By using blogs and other social media, including Facebook and Twitter, more than three thousand groups and individuals signed up to oppose the merger.\n \nAnother critical strategy to raise public awareness is to make full use of the media (Ryan, Jeﬀreys, and Blozei 2012). In the same month, the NTU and media campaign groups held a press conference to urge the NCC to ﬁght the media monopoly. Later on, while the NCC was hosting the ﬁrst public hear- ing, a group of students and media reform groups rallied in front of the NCC building. These events attracted the attention of the government. As a result, the Legislative Yuan invited one of the scholars to attend their meeting. After that, several workshops were held by these journalism and communication scholars in order to attract more media coverage and the attention of the public and the governments. The public pressure urged the NCC to postpone the approval. \nOn February 6, 2012, sixty-six people signed up with the “No China Times Movement” against the interference of China Times on media freedom. There was also a concern on how Want Want might have unbalanced news reports that favored the Chinese government. On May 7, 2012, the NCC held a sec- ond public hearing on the merger. One thing worth mentioning is that there were diﬀerent points of view at the time. Some scholars opposed the merger, while some argued that it was diﬃcult to have a real media monopoly in Tai- wan because there were plenty of news sites. Other scholars argued that a high standard of the investigation on what stakeholders said was similar to the time when the freedom of speech was highly restricted in Taiwan.\nIn July 2012, the NCC announced a conditional approval of the merger. These conditions focused on maintaining the independence of news stations owned by the corporation, which was one of the emphases of those series of anti–media monopoly movements. After the announcement of conditional approval in September 2012, a protest involving more than nine thousand individuals was organized by the Association of Taiwan Journalists and other social groups. This was one of the biggest protests in Taiwan in the past twenty- two years.\nIn November 2012, Taiwan Law Society, Taipei Society, and Taiwan Democ- racy Watch ﬁled an Amicus curiae brief to urge the NCC to ensure that those three conditions were satisﬁed before approving the merger. In 2013, the corpo- ration did not fulﬁll those conditions; hence the NCC announced its disap- proval of the deal.\n\nASSESSmENT \nFor the ﬁrst wave of media reform movements, activists’ strategies were made based on their previous decisions and the constraints of the environments (Meyer and Staggenborg 2012). In this phase, the majority of the intellectuals were people who fought for the freedom of speech and the freedom of the Tai- wanese people. The mainstream media were controlled and inﬂuenced by the government (the main political party). Hence, having protests and publishing\n \nand commenting on alternative news magazines and newspapers were the main strategies used.\nFor the second wave of media reform movements, scholars and media reform activists had tried to gain the awareness of the government and the public for the importance of “no political power, no government inﬂuence on media.” Writing critiques/letters in the mainstream media and conducting protests and strikes were the main strategies they used.\nFor the third wave of media reform movements, the approach to informa- tion and communication policies was more mixed and involved a combination of content, economic, and rights issues. Compared with two other wave move- ments, media activists had more resources (more possible media outlets) and networks (more institutions to form allies). As Fetner and Sanders (2012) point out, building up institutions for social movements is critical to the success of movements.\nIn ﬁghting against media monopolies, all ﬁve actions mentioned in Hackett and Carroll (2006) were utilized. Speciﬁcally, these movements emphasized the speciﬁc cultural environment (the relationship between China and Taiwan) for freedom of speech in Taiwan (to avoid inﬂuence by the political power of China). Fighting for media justice (for people who were sued by the China Times for criticizing the newspaper) was another action taken. Participating in multiple actions and using multiple networks were critical strategies in the movement’s success.\n\nTHE RELE VANCE OF ALTERNATIVE AND CITIZEN MEDIA \nMedia reformers in Taiwan also engaged in the expansion of independent and citizen media. For example, they launched several websites with the purpose of empowering citizen journalists. Among these websites, civilmedia.tw and we- report.org are the most active in producing citizen videos and crowdfunded independent investigative journalism. Both websites were established and managed by media reformers who are also the key ﬁgures of the Campaign for Media Reform in Taiwan as well as the Media Watch Foundation.\nCivilmedia.tw is an alternative, independent media website in Taiwan (see www.civilmedia.tw/about for details). The site originated from a research proj- ect funded by the National Science Foundation, Taiwan, in 2007–2012, and was oﬃcially established in 2012. The site aims to record social movements that are ignored in mainstream media. By using interviews and video recordings, these movements and events can be shared with the public as another resource to understand social events. There are more than 1500 records in the database in the past ﬁve years. These records are not limited to media-related events. In fact, the database includes details on human rights, cultural issues, immigra- tion, tax reform, community news, education, social welfare, and other events\n \nand topics. Civilmedia.tw also works with a PTS program to broadcast impor- tant social movements every week. In addition, civilmedia.tw is connected to social networking sites—including Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus—to reach more people and have more interaction with the public.\nWeReport.org was established by the Quality News Development Associa- tion at the media reform annual meeting in May 2011. On December 3, 2013, wereport.org was oﬃcially launched online. It is the ﬁrst nonproﬁt investigative report platform and is supported by donations from the public. By posting one’s proposal for a news reporting project, donors can choose projects they would like to support. Since 2011, there have been more than ﬁve hundred donors and more than thirty-seven projects proposed on the platform. Similar to civilme- dia.tw, weReport.org also has outlets on social networking sites, including Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Plurk, and RSS.\n\nMEDIA STRATEGIES IN TAIWAN \nOverall, these important media reform organizations and websites were origi- nally proposed by media scholars and social movement activists. They started by forming a small association and then looked for alliances and, most impor- tantly, the participation of the public. Websites and social networking sites (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Plurk) are essential platforms to reach more people. Open platform and open access are the principles shared by these orga- nizations. They also cooperate with each other with regard to improving media performance and citizen journalism in Taiwan.\nSimilar to the strategies used by Free Press and other media reform activists in the United States, social persuasion and grassroots movements have also been utilized by media reform activists in Taiwan (Lo 2012). Media watch and media literacy education, alternative media, media labor protests, and media policy advocacy are all important strategies used by media reform activists in Taiwan (Lo 2012).\nBesides, many diﬀerent institutions and organizations have been involved in these media-reform–related movements. With regard to media reform, collab- oration is more helpful and more useful than letting every tub stand on its own (Ryan and Gamson 2011).\n\nCONCL USION \nMedia reform movements in Taiwan have fought for freedom of speech and a more democratic media environment. These movements started from ﬁghting for media privatization and liberalization to remove the inﬂuence of political parties, government, and military over the mass media, to ﬁghting media monopolies in order to protect the diversity of media and a wide range of ideas.\n \nDuring the past ten years, media reform movements have been growing, lead- ing to the establishment of civil society in Taiwan.\nThe ﬁght against government control is not easy. Still, it is no less diﬃcult for the public to see the importance of separating political parties, government, and military from broadcasters. To achieve this goal, protests and public cri- tiques concerning mass media were made, leading to public discussions and eventually to legal reform.\nThe path for ﬁghting against a media monopoly in Taiwan mentioned in this chapter can be concluded as COMEPA: comments, media, exposure, protest, allies. This chapter argues that a coalition that consisted of a number of schol- ars, media reform groups (such as Taiwan Media Watch and the Campaign of Media Reform in Taiwan), various kinds of social groups, and the public can be a powerful force to express the opinions of the public. First of all, scholars and media reform groups need to create an agenda to draw the public’s atten- tion. Second, it is essential to form alliances with various social groups to generate more comments, host workshops, and create protests (online and oﬄine). Both the traditional media and online social media can be used to express their views. Furthermore, public participation is the key to success. These are strategies used in the anti–media monopoly movements in Taiwan to inﬂuence the government to prevent the formation of media monopoly that might impede the freedom of speech. However, these strategies have their limitations and challenges.\nAs mentioned above, with great media exposure through traditional mass media and social media, these movements reached a considerable amount of people to participate in the movements. However, there remains an “unreach- able” public; reaching every person continues to be a big challenge for media reform movements.\nIn addition, the existence of a “cold” public is another challenge. To improve the awareness of the importance of media reform, similar to the NCMR (National Conference for Media Reform) hosted by the Free Press in the United States, the Campaign for Media Reform and Media Watch Taiwan have hosted media reform meetings annually. Media Watch also provides courses on media education, including media literacy and the production of citizen jour- nalism. However, only limited people can sign up for these courses. It is essen- tial to cooperate with more local communities and schools to provide media literacy education and to persuade the public on the importance of media reform.\nLast but not least, the ongoing media reform movements that are ﬁghting media monopoly and pressing for a more independent and well-functioning public media system have presented a real challenge. Still, as McChesney (2007, 1) has pointed out, “we are in the midst of a communication and infor- mation revolution.” Fighting for a completely independent public broadcast- ing system remains diﬃcult. When the media system is partially funded by the\n \ngovernment, maintaining its accountability while ensuring its sustainability has been a dilemma in many countries around the world. Media reform still has a long way to go.\n\n\n"

      "content": "### CHAPTER TWELVE: Media Reform Movements in Taiwan\n#### By Hsin-Yi Sandy Tsai, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan & Shih-Hung Lo, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan\n\n#### MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY\nMedia reform strategies in Taiwan have been largely effective in raising awareness and influencing government policies on media freedom and media democratization. Reform movements addressed issues including public media promotion and opposition to media mergers, leveraging public engagement and lobbying, while also confronting hostility from mainstream media and a passive government response. New and social media have become key tools for advancing media reform goals.\n\n#### THE CHANGING MEDIA LANDSCAPE IN TAIWAN\nTaiwan, transitioning from an authoritarian regime to a more open society, faced significant media transformation with liberalization and privatization. Despite increased media outlets, major concerns remain over media consolidation, commercialism, and the impact on the quality and diversity of content.\n\n#### MEDIA REFORM MOVEMENTS IN TAIWAN\nTaiwan experienced three waves of media reform: (1) privatization and liberalization post-martial law; (2) the push for expanding public media; and (3) battling significant media mergers. The formation of Public Television Services (PTS) and Taiwan Broadcasting Service (TBS) was a major achievement for media reform, emphasizing public service and independence from government influence.\n\n#### THE CAMPAIGN FOR EXPANDING PUBLIC MEDIA\nThe second wave fought to create capable public media entities that offer quality and diverse content with universality, independence, and a focus on serving the public interest. Advocacy led to significant debate surrounding the establishment and management of PTS and TBS.\n\n#### THE FIGHT OVER BIG MEDIA MERGERS\nMarket consolidation became a concern with the advent of media convergence, leading to activism against mergers like Want Want China Times' attempts to acquire multiple media platforms. Intense review, public opposition, and pressure influenced the National Communications Commission (NCC) to eventually disapprove of the mergers.\n\n#### ASSESSMENT\nReform movements began with protests and critique, later incorporating diverse strategies to engage public interest and apply political pressure. The COMEPA framework (comments, media, exposure, protest, allies) was instrumental in rallying opposition to media monopolies and influencing government action. However, achieving widespread public reach and engagement remains a consistent challenge.\n\n#### THE RELEVANCE OF ALTERNATIVE AND CITIZEN MEDIA\nMedia activists were proactive in creating platforms such as Civilmedia.tw and WeReport.org to cultivate citizen journalism and offer alternatives to mainstream media. These enabled broader participation and provided independent coverage of events often neglected by traditional outlets.\n\n#### CONCLUSION\nThe future of media reform in Taiwan will continue to challenge the status quo, seeking highly independent public media systems while contending with governmental funding-related dilemmas. The reform efforts aim not only at policy changes but also to enhance media literacy and engage local communities further in the movement. The vision is clear: a democratic media landscape that genuinely serves the public."

To frame campaigns and create a broad base of sup- port, organizations need to know the history of media development in their jurisdic- tions, the current competing power structures and discourses about the media, and the unique barriers to media reform. (2) Seek collaborations and coalitions. Net- working and collaborating with other organizations, campaigns, and events can help enhance organizational reach and resources, as well as increase awareness of the need for media reform in other social-justice ﬁelds and organizations. (3) Seek sup- port from academic institutions. Support from universities and colleges can help legitimate reform organizations; add expertise to campaigns, regulatory proceedings, and public debates; and generate volunteers through student placements and intern- ships. (4) Use multiple campaign approaches and modes of engagement. Online campaign tactics (such as e-petitions or social media organizing) combined with oﬄine traditional communications tactics (such as town hall discussions, street teams, or presentations to regulatory committees) engage the largest number of peo- ple. Similarly, campaign goals should be framed in simple, straightforward terms that can be easily grasped by people of diﬀerent ages and diverse backgrounds.\n\nThis chapter examines three contemporary media reform initiatives in Anglo- phone Canada: (1) Media Democracy Day (MDD), an annual public event in\n\n167\n \nVancouver British Columbia that brings together community groups, scholars, activists and independent media practitioners to develop strategies for democ- ratizing media content and structure; (2) OpenMedia (OM), an organization that has had substantial success bringing pressure on the media regulatory arena using social media and online organizing tools; and (3) Reimagine CBC, a national campaign conducted by a coalition of three youth-oriented activist groups in response to political and ﬁnancial challenges mounted against the Canadian public broadcaster.\nSet against the larger backdrop of media reform in Canada, it brieﬂy high- lights the historical conditions and circumstances that frame contemporary media reform eﬀorts in Canada and considers the successes and challenges these campaigns have had in animating broader public interest and achieving particular media reform–related goals. It considers their communication strat- egies, use of social media, and involvement in coalition building, and it exam- ines their lessons learned in developing campaigns, engaging with those new to media reform goals, and approaches to developing relationships with wider movements for social justice. Of particular interest are the ways they have man- aged to overcome traditional barriers to reform, as well as the ways in which the larger political economic conditions have worked to circumscribe their growth and development. Finally, drawing from the experiences of these cases we sug- gest four broad organizational strategies for media reform initiatives.\n\nDE VEL OP ING A CTIVISM \nCanada has a long history of citizen’s groups, labor organizations, and academ- ics agitating for comprehensive media and telecommunications systems that serve the public interest (Babe 1990; Girard 1992; Goldberg 1990; Hackett and Carroll 2006). But such activism has been spotty and much of it has been conﬁned to simply testifying at the many federal government enquiries and commissions over the years (Canada 1970, 1981, 2005, 2006). Once these formal inquiries were over, there was very little pressure on the government of the day to follow up on recommendations and, generally, they have not done so (Skinner and Gasher 2005). In some quarters, this has led to the conclusion that perhaps the only way to get reform on legislative and regula- tory agendas is through broad and sustained public pressure (Creery 1984). However, with a few exceptions, public pressure has not been developed in a sustained way.\nThere are at least three reasons for this diﬃculty. First, there is the structure of the regulatory process itself. Participating in that process is expensive and requires considerable resources in terms of time, money, and knowledge. Take the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), Canada’s broadcast and telecommunications regulator, for example. Hearings are generally conducted in Ottawa, making attendance in person dif-\n \nﬁcult. At the same time, keeping up with the CRTC’s regulatory agenda and undertaking the research necessary to understand the possible social, political, and economic impacts of the issues it addresses is very diﬃcult without consid- erable time for research, or the beneﬁt of paid staﬀ, something very few besides major media corporations can aﬀord. Participating in other regulatory pro- cesses requires similar resources.\nA second, related problem is funding for nongovernment and noncorporate organizations in Canada. In the United States, media activist organizations such as Free Press and the Media and Democracy Coalition receive signiﬁcant funding from foundations, philanthropic organizations, and institutional members. In Canada, with its small population and history of branch plant industry, access to such resources is severely limited (Skinner 2012).\nThird, prior to the Internet, developing a broad base of support for media reform without the resources to mount high-proﬁle publicity campaigns, com- plete with direct mail or telephone contacts, was an almost impossible task. This is further complicated by the fact that media reform is often viewed by activists in ﬁelds such as labor, race, gender, or environment as secondary to their primary concerns (Hackett and Carroll 2006, 199–209).\nAll three examples of media reform activism discussed in this section address these obstacles: Media Democracy Day through utilizing a range of techniques to build public awareness of, and participation in, media reform issues and concerns; and OpenMedia.ca and Reimagine CBC through using both Internet-based social networks and broadly focused campaign strategies to develop and expedite media reform campaigns.\n\nm EDIA DEmOCRACY DAY\nThe ﬁrst Media Democracy Day (MDD) was organized in Vancouver and Toronto in 2001 in response to escalating concentration of media ownership and its attendant threats to the diversity of media content. Since that time, similar events have been organized across Canada and the United States, as well as in Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. But it has enjoyed its greatest success in Vancouver where over the last four years it has evolved into one of the premiere media reform events in Canada where—with two days of panel discussions, ﬁlm screenings, keynote talks, workshops, and a media fair—it attracts over three thousand attendees.\nMDD’s action plan is reﬂected in the tag line, “Know the media. Be the media. Change the media.” To know the media, refers to the need for evidence-based research on ownership structures, production, and distribution patterns, labor practices, and patterns of media content. This forms the basis for eﬀecting change. To be the media signiﬁes the commitment to citizen input and alternative media content. In this regard, MDD activities include a trade show–style media fair of independent media groups, as well as hands-on training workshops. To\n \nchange the media refers to questions of policy, regulation, and laws, including copyright legislation, Internet throttling, concentration of ownership, and sup- port for culturally important areas such as independent ﬁlmmaking and public broadcasting.\nMDD seeks to build the media reform movement through emphasizing the importance of “communicative democracy” (Hackett 2000) to new audiences and organizations every year, consciously pitching MDD as a gateway event to communities and organizations whose interests overlap with media reform goals, such as social groups and activist organizations whose issues are misrep- resented, underreported, or ignored by the corporate media. In this way, MDD organizers follow the advice of US media activist Robert McChesney (2005, 11) who—when speaking to other social justice activists—argued that “whatever your ﬁrst issue of concern, media had better be your second, because without change in the media, progress in your primary area is far less likely.” To develop program content, MDD also seeks input from this social justice community using both web-based targeted communication and small community meet- ings, and then approaches speciﬁc organizations directly to take part. For example, MDD 2012 included a panel discussion called “Muzzling the Scien- tists,” about the increasing media restrictions placed on government scientists by the Conservative federal government, and contacted numerous environ- mental organizations, scientist associations and science faculties at universities and colleges to advertise the event. Another panel, “Decolonizing the Media,” included representatives from the South Asian and aboriginal leadership and was targeted at their respective communities. Further, all the events are free of charge and held at the easily accessible main branch of the Vancouver Public Library in downtown Vancouver.\nMDD has been a successful strategy for increasing information sharing with\nboth the general public and citizen engagement groups (demonstrated by the fact that over 50 percent of attendees in 2012 were new to MDD), and one that has also been a catalyst for new forms of media activism and independent journalism. For example, the award-winning online magazine The Tyee (www\n.thetyee.ca) was launched at MDD and similar collaborations have occurred through the media fair.\nThe structure of MDD is based on collaborations between scholars, media practitioners, and social justice activists. The organizing committee is presently housed in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University, a critical communication program for the last forty years, and both faculty members and representatives of community organizations sit on the steering committee. As a joint university-community organization MDD seeks to provide a link between research and practice and works to ensure a combination of scholars, practi- tioners, and activists on every panel. The 2012 event program listed over thirty speakers, as well as additional partnerships with ﬁfteen groups and associations from seven postsecondary institutions, seventeen community and media spon-\n \nsors, four labor unions, and ﬁve other social justice organizations and media practitioners. In addition, over thirty independent media-making groups were highlighted at the media fair.\nSome partnerships have been particularly beneﬁcial over the last twelve years. The UBC School of Journalism has been a supporter of MDD and sees the event as an avenue for its students to learn about and conduct journalism in the public interest. Library and archivist associations have been mainstays at the event, as have civil liberties organizations and groups concerned about freedom of information and privacy rights.\nThe collaborative nature of MDD appears to have helped sustain the organi- zation and its longevity can be attributed to a number of factors including its aﬃliation with Simon Fraser University, attention to broad-based community collaborations, and its triple foci of media analysis, policy change, and creating alternative media. Reaching out to new groups and organizations each year with program content that speaks to the importance of democratic media helps to recruit new supporters, volunteers, and donors. However, as with many projects, it is limited by resources and has yet to develop an ongoing and reli- able source of funding. MDD has periodic part-time staﬀ and relies on volun- teer eﬀorts primarily from the School of Communication and other academic institutions and social justice groups in Vancouver. Thus, an inordinate amount of time is spent fundraising and seeking small donations from other social justice groups.\n\nOpENmEDIA \nIn May 2007, University of Windsor’s Communication Studies department convened a conference to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Manufacturing Consent by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky (1989). Riding a wave of enthusiasm for media reform generated at that event, Steve Anderson, a gradu- ate student at Simon Fraser University’s School of Communication, set up Canadians for Democratic Media (CDM) in Vancouver, British Columbia. Aiming to establish an umbrella group of organizations drawn from both those involved in media reform as well as newcomers to the enterprise, CDM’s initial mandate was to “create a common front among groups promoting reform of print, broadcast, and web-based media” (CDM 2008, 2). Funding was cobbled together from small grants and in-kind donations from labor unions, other activist organizations, and individuals. A handful of academics and activists worked with Anderson to craft an organizational mandate and policy positions. For the ﬁrst two years CDM was involved with a range of campaigns broadly focused on issues surrounding concentration of ownership, community media, the Internet, and journalism. Their website provided campaign information, a place to sign people to their mailing list, and a page where people could make a direct submission to government hearings on these issues. CDM delegations\n \nmade several trips to Ottawa to appear before hearings. The organization also published several reports related to media issues (Hackett and Anderson 2010). Based upon preliminary ﬁndings of one of these reports, CDM was rebranded in 2010 to reﬂect the growing strength of the open movement. The new name, OpenMedia (OM), reﬂected the organization’s commitment to pursuing and creating an open, accessible media system in Canada in both the public and private sectors. Money was very tight, however, and Anderson spent much of his time fundraising.\nAbout the same time, some large Canadian media companies began pursuing vertical integration between content and carriage (Krashinsky 2010; Laduran- taye 2010). The Internet and the wireless markets were key to these corporate plays, and the mergers sparked a series of struggles over the dimensions of pub- lic policy in this emerging ﬁeld. Net neutrality became a key site of struggle and, along with a number of other activist organizations, OM participated in several campaigns in this area.\nA major turning point for the organization and online organizing in Canada came in 2009 when OM launched the Stop the Meter campaign. This cam- paign sought to intervene in a CRTC decision to allow wholesale Internet providers the power to impose “usage-based billing” (pay per byte) on indepen- dent Internet service providers and, therefore, many Canadian Internet users. Deploying social media, and particularly Facebook, to accelerate the message, over the course of several months the Stop the Meter campaign garnered over three hundred thousand signatures to its online petition and ﬂooded the CRTC oﬃces with over one hundred thousand comments—an unprecedented level of public engagement with telecommunications policy. Interestingly, and without prompting from OM, many supporters created videos, comics, post- ers, T-shirts, websites, and other campaign materials, held protests in their local communities, and donated money for ads in major newspapers. The campaign pressured the CRTC to change their decision from one that favored the large telecommunications companies to one that has been characterized as more friendly to other stakeholders. The petition remains active to keep pressure on the CRTC and now has over ﬁve hundred thousand signatures. In the face of this apparent broad public concern and commitment to Internet access and aﬀordability, OM’s focus turned from media issues in general to those speciﬁ- cally related to the Internet.\nRecent OM campaigns have not matched the level of support of Stop the\nMeter, but some have drawn well over one hundred thousand signatures. In this regard, OM has set a new benchmark for online organizing in Canada, working through social media, campaign videos, and graphics. At the same time, OM has not abandoned traditional media strategies such as newspaper ads and letters to the editor. Campaign websites include a “letter to the editor” tool that allows supporters to easily draft and send letters, usually aimed at news- papers located in the target politicians’ home constituencies (cf. openmedia.ca/\n \nletter). These tactics are combined with direct lobbying of both elected and nonelected oﬃcials and other traditional methods, such as presenting petitions at politicians’ oﬃces, to help build and sustain pressure for policy changes. While it is diﬃcult to gauge the impact of any one group or individual on public policy processes, OM does appear to have had inﬂuence on the out- come of a number of Internet-related issues (Payton 2013). Given its successes, OM’s work has also been recognized with a national award and employees are now regularly consulted by regulators, policy-makers, and the mainstream media.\nOver the last ﬁve years OM has grown from a loose association of like-minded groups and individuals to become what the organization itself refers to as a citizen-driven, pro-Internet community or movement (openmedia.ca/operate). Social media, and particularly Facebook, have been important in constructing this larger community. OM operates with a full-time staﬀ of more than ten, and their raised public proﬁle has enhanced fundraising opportunities. Indeed, while other activist organizations continue to play an important role in provid- ing resources and funding, almost 75 percent of donations in 2011 came from individuals (OM 2011).\nOne of the keys to OM’s success in developing and maintaining their sup- porters is that they frame complex issues in simple, populist language that relates to everyday experience, particularly for young people. For instance, Stop the Meter (openmedia.ca/meter) took a rather arcane regulatory process dealing with the technicalities of Internet traﬃc management and presented it as put- ting a parking meter on individual Internet accounts. No Internet Lockdown (openmedia.ca/lockdown) presented legislation dealing with complex copyright and intellectual property law as containing provisions to lock down or restrict use of the Internet. And the highly secretive Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership trade negotiations were framed as an Internet trap (stopthetrap.net) which may result in a number of highly repressive laws and regulations negatively aﬀecting Inter- net activity. Campaign narratives also utilize a recognizable set of villains—Big Media or Big Telecom—and goals are framed in generalized populist terms such as the need for more choice, aﬀordability, openness, transparency, or account- ability. Both campaign framing and language are also carefully scrutinized to avoid alienating supporters who identify as coming from across the political spectrum. To promote political inclusivity, OM identiﬁes itself as a postpartisan organization (openmedia.ca/operate).\nThe large constituency constructed through social media using these rhe- torical strategies, coupled with the fact that OM has been able to motivate people to sign petitions and directly contact politicians and regulators, legiti- mates the claim that they are a citizens’ movement. They have successfully overcome some of the ﬁnancial and geographical barriers to participation in regulatory processes in Ottawa and provided people a voice in that venue. But while OM has enjoyed considerable success, the organization’s growth and\n \ndevelopment has been circumscribed by its ﬁnancial circumstances. Revenue streams require constant tending and current reliance on supporter-based rev- enue has gone hand in hand with an increasing focus on Internet-related issues.\n\nREImAGINE CBC \nWhile OpenMedia’s major focus shifted to the Internet, it has at times contin- ued to collaborate with other organizations on broader issues of media and public service. One of the major projects that emerged in this regard was Re- imagine CBC which focused on protecting and strengthening Canada’s public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).\nWhile public broadcasting in Canada, as in many other jurisdictions, has been under attack for over a decade, the election of Stephen Harper’s Conser- vative government in 2006 saw the acceleration of budget cuts and calls for the complete defunding of the CBC. In the wake of these attacks, and an impend- ing CBC license renewal hearing, OpenMedia joined forces with Leadnow and Gen Why Media in January 2012 to launch a campaign designed to engage Canadians in a discussion about the value of the CBC and to encourage suggestions for making it more responsive to the interests of Canadians (Re- imagine CBC n.d.). Importantly, all three partners were known as youth- oriented and new media-savvy groups that emphasized civic engagement, participatory processes and public dialogue. Leadnow.ca was launched in March 2011, just before a federal election, with the intention of increasing democratic participation and voter turnout among youth Canada. Gen Why Media began in 2010 as a ﬁlm project (the name refers to generational theorists’ use of “generation Y” to categorize those born in the 1980s) and expanded to work toward changing social structures through events to encourage civic engagement. While Gen Why Media was primarily local, both OM and Lead- now.ca had the reach to make Reimagine CBC a national project.\nWith these organizations’ youth-oriented supporters in mind, the campaign sought to inﬂuence the CBC’s strategic planning by developing a “crowd sourced plan to enable the CBC to take on a leadership position in the digital era” (Reimagine CBC 2012). The campaign began with a website launch in January 2012. They explicitly stated their starting principles as supporting the role of public media as “good for democracy” and the importance of the public broadcaster to become nimble in terms of new media and technology. Based on questions of how the CBC could be more interactive, community based, par- ticipatory, encourage citizen-powered culture, and foster creativity and collabo- ration, they asked Canadians to submit their ideas about the kind of public broadcaster they wanted the CBC to be. In this way, they built an online com- munity and an initial list of ideas and opinions. The website also encouraged people to post their own ideas and comments. The site also included testimo- nials from artists, writers, educators, and others to advertise the campaign.\n \nAnother section of the website allowed people to celebrate their favorite CBC moments, collecting stories and memories of the role of the public broadcaster in people’s lives. Running from January to April 2012, almost 1,500 Canadians took part in this ﬁrst phase of the campaign.\nAt the same time, Reimagine CBC created an online and paper-based peti- tion that called on the government to stop the cuts to the CBC in the upcoming federal budget. The petition garnered more than twenty-ﬁve thousand signatures, and volunteers hand-delivered these petitions to thirteen Member of Parliament (MP) constituency oﬃces. Nonetheless, the spring budget announced a 10 per- cent cut to the CBC, and the Reimagine CBC campaign switched its focus to the CBC license renewal hearings upcoming in the fall.\nImportantly, the campaign was not limited to web-based tactics, but used multifaceted strategies to engage Canadians in this broad-based consultation. They conducted person-to-person engagement events, including street teams, visits to senior homes, and a youth-oriented public event. Four months into the campaign, Reimagine CBC was ready to report to the public about what they had heard so far. They did so with a large public event held on May 7, 2012, in Vancouver. Over one thousand people attended and some ﬁve hun- dred people watched via webcam. They reported on the ﬁrst phase of the campaign and included performances from spoken-word poets, musicians, writers, and a panel discussion about how to make the CBC stronger and more relevant to Canadians.\nOver the next few months, organizers developed a modular survey from the crowdsourcing feedback that reﬂected a list of six major priorities highlighted by the participants. During this second phase of the consultation process, people were encouraged to rank these priorities in order of importance. In all, almost eleven thousand people participated in this online survey. At the same time the campaign held twenty-eight gatherings across the county to seek feed- back from those who may not yet have had a chance to comment. By the time the campaign held its second large public event in Toronto in October 2012, it was clear that Reimagine CBC had conducted one of the most creative and comprehensive public consultation processes ever seen about the future of the CBC or the role of media in Canada. In all, over thirty-ﬁve thousand people participated in the consultation process in one way or another. Its ﬁnal report, Make It Yours, was submitted to the CRTC at the CBC’s licensing hearing in November 2012. It was clear from the consultation that Canadians were deeply supportive of the public broadcaster. The survey put the highest priority on “courageous” and “in-depth” reporting as the key to CBC purpose. The other four recommendations included prioritizing radio, enriching the digital archive, collaborating with communities more to develop authentic Canadian stories, and using open and participatory processes to help shape CBC’s vision. Upon presentation of the report to the CRTC the campaign earned praise from the CRTC chair as a model of citizen participation.\n \nWhy did this campaign have such buy-in from the public? Collaboration, public engagement, a combination of web-based and traditional communica- tion methods, creative approaches, cross-generational focus—all of these ele- ments combined to help build public participation.\n\nORGANIZ ATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR MEDIA REFORM \nEach of these Canadian examples takes a diﬀerent approach to media reform. MDD’s focus is to hold public events, create a platform for media reform col- laborations, and increase the capacity and opportunity for alternative media content. One of the advantages of MDD pitching its events to new communi- ties of interest, and facilitating collaborations, is that it has succeeded in creating a sustainable event that attracts thousands of people a year, many of whom are new to media reform. However, while building public awareness of media issues, there is no way to gauge the organization’s impact on public policy or the media environment in general.\nWorking from another position, OM was forged in the peculiar political economy of the Canadian media system to become eﬀective Internet-oriented campaigners for policy change around primarily Internet-oriented issues. Uti- lizing social media and careful rhetorical framing of issues, it has been able to develop a very large set of supporters and thus overcome some of the traditional ﬁnancial barriers to organizing media reform eﬀorts in Canada. But in its eﬀorts to establish a ﬁrm base of support, it appears to have somewhat limited the range of its campaigning work.\nFinally, Reimagine CBC was a collaborative project that had the express pur- pose of conducting a short intensive campaign in support of the public broad- caster and focused on its license renewal hearing as the ﬁnal goal. It was unprecedented in its scope, use of multifaceted tactics, and public engagement, but was disbanded soon after the CRTC hearing and had no follow-up capacity. These three examples oﬀer some interesting ideas and insights on how to engage people in media reform, notwithstanding their diﬀerent goals and unique\npositioning. Four of these insights are discussed in the following sections.\n\nUNDERSTAND YOUR REGIONAL AND NATIONAL CONTEXT \nWhile it may seem obvious, it is worth emphasizing the importance of under- standing the issues, debates, and struggles that give rise to the policies and structures media reform groups are trying to change. National media systems arise out of diﬀerent political and economic pressures, and thus social and historical context oﬀers insight to tailoring strategies for media reform. For instance, in Canada, regional diﬀerences in media access and coverage some-\n \ntimes call for diﬀerent campaign approaches in diﬀerent locales. What works on the West Coast where media ownership concentration is particularly high, does not always play the same way in the center of the country where there is more media choice. Similarly, drawing upon the country’s peculiar mythology about media development and the role of the media in democracy can oﬀer opportunities for framing campaigns. For example, Canada’s historical debates about cultural sovereignty vis-à-vis the United States have been evoked in a number of campaigns (cf. OM’s Fair Deal Campaign). At another level, learn- ing from and strategically positioning oneself in relation to the work of other domestic reform groups can be important. The Reimagine CBC campaign did not merely repeat the work of others who have championed the CBC; rather it drew upon traditional narrative and rationales for public broadcasting while using knowledge of youth and web cultures and an understanding of crowd- sourcing methods to fashion a unique dialogue about a renewed public service model. Thus, it created new tactics for championing an old institution. Finally, understanding the national context also means acknowledging barriers to media reform. For example, MDD has recognized the lack of public knowledge and opportunities for engagement about media reform issues, and responded by pitching its work at an entry level, oﬀering discussions and events that help edu- cate people about media reform issues and concerns. Similarly, recognizing the diﬃculty in accomplishing fundamental political and policy change, OM’s cam- paigns generally focus upon incremental policy change. And, because Canada lacks many philanthropic foundations from which to raise core funding, organiz- ers have had to be particularly creative in fundraising.\n\nSEEK COLLABORATIONS AND COALITIONS \nAll three examples networked with a range of social justice groups and organiza- tions who were not strictly involved in the media reform movement, thereby building their reach and resources. OM works to create a large constituency by making a claim to postpartisanship which can, at times, limit the range and depth of their progressive actions but, at the same time, has been successful at creating coalitions with groups that might not have traditionally supported its work. For its Stop the Meter campaign, it joined with consumer interest groups whose political orientation was diﬀerent from OM’s, but whose goals in this campaign were similar: aﬀordable Internet access. Depending on the situation, it has also forged alliances with unions as well as small telecommunications companies and other private sector organizations whose goals and ambitions meet with the objectives of particular campaigns. While such partnerships can draw criticism for being opportunist, they can also provide much needed resources and can make the diﬀerence between success and failure. Further, both MDD and Reimagine CBC are examples of coalition-building approaches that generated interest with groups and citizens outside of the media reform sector.\n \nShort-term campaign-speciﬁc collaborations with other social justice groups can also oﬀer the beneﬁt of doubling up on memberships and mail-lists, with- out the long-term headache of requiring agreement on long-term goals. Seeking collaborations, however, may have drawbacks. For instance, media reform groups need to be careful about overidentifying with particular political parties rather than speciﬁc policy proposals.\n\nSEEK SUppORT FRO m ACADE m IC INSTITUTIONS \nWhile support from institutions such as foundations and unions can be invalu- able, we cannot emphasize enough the important role of scholars and their academic institutions in providing resources and support for the work of media reform. While, as a scholar, taking on the role of reform advocate may have consequences, such academic alliances create a level of legitimacy for the orga- nization; add expertise to campaign outcomes, regulatory proceedings, and public debates; and can serve as vehicles of critical pedagogy for postsecondary students. All three examples reviewed here emerged or were assisted by aca- demic involvement. The ﬁrst Media Democracy Day in 2001 originated in part through the work of graduates and faculty in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University. This aﬃliation with SFU continues today, as other faculty members have become leaders in the organization and new graduate and undergraduate students have become involved. The university is a great source of student volunteers and annual funding for MDD which, while extremely limited, still provides a basis of continuity. Similarly, the academy played an important role in animating the development of OM and provided both tech- nical and material support in the early days of its development. Several of the founders were university professors and Steve Anderson was an alumnus of both graduate and undergraduate communication programs. Because OM is based in Vancouver, the School of Communication at Simon Fraser is an important source of student interns and staﬀ, and scholars aﬃliated with other academic institutions across the country have also been involved as board members and collaborators, while student clubs have formed at other univer- sities, such as McGill University in Montreal. As the organization grew and became self-sustaining, the role of the academy became less important, but scholars continue to legitimate OM campaigns by delivering expert testimony at regulatory hearings and assisting with policy and research documents. \n\nUSE mULTI p LE CAmpAIGN AppROACHES AND m ODES OF ENGAGEmENT \nFinally, all three of these examples show the importance of using both tradi- tional and new media campaign techniques to reach both the public and policy\n \nmakers. OM has created impressive online campaigns and Reimagine CBC utilized a simple yet eﬀective online consultation and collaboration approach. Yet, all three examples also highlight the importance of traditional campaign tools, such as town hall discussions, street teams, large public events, circulat- ing hard copy petitions, and directly engaging politicians and regulators. For instance, Reimagine CBC visited community centers and senior citizens’ homes. OM conducts street interventions, delivers hard copy petitions to political oﬃces, sends out traditional press releases and encourages letters to the editors of newspapers. MDD seeks out radio interviews, submits editorial columns to newspapers and makes classroom visits to post-secondary classes.\n\nCONCL USION \nAll three examples emphasize participation in their campaigns, providing people with a range of possible ways to become involved—from organizing and creating campaign materials, to directly voicing speciﬁc concerns, to attending public events or simply signing a petition. At the same time, all three illustrate that campaign goals need to be framed in simple, straightforward terms that can be easily grasped by people of diﬀerent ages and with diverse backgrounds and education. All three have also illustrated that public meetings can be an important means of developing and galvanizing public interest in reform. And OpenMedia and Reimagine CBC have shown that online activ- ism can help break down traditional barriers to the regulatory process and enable large numbers of people to make their voices heard. While some media reform groups may be more comfortable with either traditional or new media organizing, it appears that it is the combination of these activities that fueled the success of these three examples.

      "content": "### CHAPTER THIRTEEN: Organizing for Media Reform in Canada\n#### By Kathleen Cross, Simon Fraser University, Canada & David Skinner, York University, Canada\n\n#### MEDIA REFORM STRATEGY\nThe chapter examines three Canadian media reform initiatives: Media Democracy Day (MDD), OpenMedia (OM), and Reimagine CBC. It offers four strategic insights for organizing media reform: understanding the regional and national context, forming collaborations and coalitions, acquiring support from academic institutions, and employing multiple campaign approaches and engagement modes.\n\n#### DEVELOPING ACTIVISM\nMedia reform activism in Canada has traditionally been limited to testifying at government inquiries. The obstacles include the prohibitive cost of participation in the regulatory process, limited funding sources, and the challenge of developing public support without widespread campaigns. MDD, OM, and Reimagine CBC have engaged in creative strategies to address these barriers.\n\n#### MEDIA DEMOCRACY DAY (MDD)\nMDD in Vancouver has evolved into a major annual event focused on democratizing media content and structure. It promotes public engagement and facilitates alternative media content. MDD is sustained through collaboration between academic institutions, community groups, and social justice organizations, offering versatile programs meant to raise awareness about media reform.\n\n#### OPENMEDIA (OM)\nOM stands out for its success in utilizing social media and online organizing tools to bring pressure on media regulation, exemplified by the impactful \"Stop the Meter\" campaign. OM effectively frames complex issues in simple language that resonates with the general public and has developed into a significant movement for Internet-oriented policy change.\n\n#### REIMAGINE CBC\nReimagine CBC was a national campaign focused on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's public broadcasting role. Through broad-based consultations, they crafted a crowdsourced plan for a more interactive, community-focused CBC. The campaign attracted significant public participation and engagement.\n\n#### ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIES FOR MEDIA REFORM\nCanada's unique media landscape, characterized by limited funding and geographical barriers, demands innovative and inclusive strategies for media reform. MDD, OM, and Reimagine CBC showcase different approaches, from public events to digital activism, but all underscore the necessity for clear communication, broad engagement, and diversified tactics.\n\n#### DEVELOPING ACTIVISM\nPersistent activism and the adaptation to various communication platforms have been integral in gaining momentum for media reform in Canada. OM stands out for its significant online presence and success in policy influence, while MDD's nurturing of academic-community collaborations helps sustain ongoing awareness and activism.\n\n#### CONCLUSION\nMedia reform in Canada continues to face challenges but through collaborative efforts, strategic understanding of the media landscape, and innovative campaigns, significant strides are being made toward fulfilling media reform goals and engaging the public in the process. The interplay of online and offline activism and clear messaging ensures wider reach and impact."

Even though Prometheus was a tiny outﬁt working out of a two-room church basement, we were able to harness the power of people who felt robbed of the community radio they needed.\n(2)\tLocal voices with meaningful stories will be heard. We encouraged people to share detailed, personal stories with legislators about how their community could use a radio station. In crowded Washington, DC, with big corporate media lob- byists shaking hands and sharing meals with our elected representatives, we found that stories about local issues spoke louder than the richest broadcasters in the world. (3) Change takes time. It took our grassroots eﬀorts ten years to get a propublic interest correction through, so choose your issues wisely. (4) Focus on the long term. The industry always has its insider advantages in the short term. Choose campaigns that will keep on making a diﬀerence in the long term, and stick with them long enough to win them. (5) Community-building events strengthen movements for the long haul. If we can come together outside of campaign work—outside of calling Congress, signing petitions, taking action— we will build a more permanent understanding of the lines that divide us and keep big media strong.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the movement for media reform in the United States was at a low ebb. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 moved through Congress with\n\n\nthe fawning support of the corporate deregulatory agenda of both parties. Americans started to feel the eﬀect within months, with hundreds of mergers and buyouts by big media corporations leading to waves of ﬁrings and loss of vital local programming.\nIn response, hundreds of small bands of activists started unlicensed, or pirate, FM radio stations, in hopes of recapturing a sliver of the public air- waves for their communities. Their goal? To give voice to those being silenced by the commercial media. We saw that whether we were ﬁghting for housing reform, an AIDS cure, peace, the environment, or anything else, a small number of corporations had a chokehold on the public’s information and were using their media properties to narrow the contours of debate and the imagination about possible solutions. We took our inspiration from Mbanna Kantako, a blind DJ in a housing project in Illinois who started a tenants’ rights radio station; and Stephen Dunifer, a peace activist and engineer who ran an antiwar radio station out of a backpack from the hills in Berkeley, California. In Dunifer’s case, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tried and failed for four years to get the courts to issue an injunction against his broadcasts. Eventually, his station was shut down in 1998, but not before close to one thousand pirate radio stations had started up in the shadow of the legal whirlpool caused by his (almost successful) case against the system of broadcast laws.\nThe FCC’s response to the unlicensed stations was twofold. First, the enforcement branch pursued ﬁnes, equipment conﬁscations, and injunctions against radio pirates. The legal confusion created by the Dunifer case created a situation much like the historic (and mythic) Wild West in the United States: the rule of law was temporarily in question as the courts reevaluated the FCC’s performance in distributing radio licenses fairly. In the vacuum of authority that followed, freewheeling radio pirates, from immigrants to anarchists to art- ists, broadcast voices that had never been heard in the mainstream. Second, FCC Chairman William Kennard, who expressed concern about the trend toward radio industry consolidation and loss of diversity of ownership, engaged the pirates to create a new, licensed, hyper-local community radio service for the country: low-power FM radio.\nFormer radio pirates formed a national group, the Prometheus Radio Proj- ect, to help steer the political debate around the new licenses, and to assist groups technically and organizationally that wanted to give voice to their communities using radio. With Kennard’s leadership, the FCC designed the LPFM service and opened the door for thousands of community groups to apply for licenses.\nThe battle with big broadcasting was far from over, however, as incumbents pushed Congress to pass an anti-LPFM bill in late 2000 that limited the FCC’s authority to grant the licenses, adding onerous restrictions that kept LPFM out of most of America’s big cities. Prometheus led a coalition in a ten-year eﬀort\n \nto restore FCC authority over community radio, and to allow community radio stations into the cities. This eﬀort was ﬁnally successful when Congress passed the Local Community Radio Act, signed by President Obama in Janu- ary 2011.\n\nTHE PR OMETHEUS RADIO PR OJECT \nThe campaign to expand low-power FM was a transformative one for the Pro- metheans who took it on. Prometheus’s founders had experience organizing demonstrations and direct actions against the City of Philadelphia, against national Republicans setting up shop in town for the Republican National Convention, as well as for many other local struggles. But we’d never had the impact to change federal regulations before, or pass laws through Congress. We weren’t really big league enough to take on the Federal government, and the Feds weren’t quite ready for us either.\nWhen thousands of LPFM applicants were denied their chance to get a com- munity radio license, we saw a constituency spread across the country. But this constituency was made up of people very unlike each other: people who wanted to have radio stations for very diﬀerent reasons. From two rooms in a West Philadelphia church basement, and from the back of an old car that had seen better days, we met the thousands who had lost their opportunity for their dream of building a community radio station including evangelical Christians in Merritt Island, Florida; Latino labor coalitions in Indianapolis; anarchists in Philadelphia; and the black Chamber of Commerce in Sacramento.\nWe developed a practice of deep conversation with all sorts of people about the unmet communications needs of their communities, and let their passion lead us. We listened to each group as they described why they wanted to be on the air, and helped them to respect the reasons provided by thousands of oth- ers. We needed to meet people where they were and to amplify to decision- makers the individual reasons why people wanted stations. One thing that helped us cross ideological lines was our emphasis on localism. In the wake of the wave of corporate mergers, many people had lost the traditional connec- tion that they had with local radio. More and more of the program content was nationally syndicated, and radio hosts—from the Left or the Right—became more distant and unapproachable and less connected to the particular town that the signal was covering. Our belief was that just like you don’t just have a president—you also have a governor and a mayor and a school board mem- ber—you need a media that has a mix of scales too. There is nothing wrong with having national media outlets, but some room on the dial needs to be reserved for smaller, local voices. This resonated for everyone, including Republicans who have often argued against the over-extension of federal pow- ers. Libertarian Congress members, like Ron Paul of Texas, wanted to hear from local people who wanted the freedom to have their voice on the air, without\n \ngovernment or corporate intervention. Left-leaning Congress members, like Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, wanted to hear about locals missing the diversity of local radio and the viewpoints of marginalized groups. Members of the Con- gressional Black Caucus and Congress members supporting immigrant voices wanted to hear about chances for minority nonproﬁts and businesses to share powerful stories, and to put power in the hands of marginalized groups to orga- nize for themselves. Coming from a history where the FCC only considered comments from lawyers in the rulemaking process, and tossed comments from the public in the wastepaper basket, this strategy seemed unorthodox. Treating individual voices like unique ﬂowers and delivering those ﬂowers to Congress members one, two, three at a time? No way.\nBut we saw our methods start to work and change minds, one at a time, in Congress. In 2007, after a number of false starts in the House led by Democratic legislators without Republican backing and after a dogged bipartisan Senate team failed to push through big broadcaster opposition to LPFM expansion, Congressman Mike Doyle and his passionate legislative aide Kenneth Degraﬀ approached us. They said that they had worked before with conservative Omaha, Nebraska, Congressman Lee Terry, and if we could demonstrate that there was powerful interest in LPFM in Omaha, he would have the wherewithal to stand up to the big broadcasters and cosponsor a bill to expand LPFM radio in the committee where it mattered the most.\nWe went deep in Omaha. We found applicants from African-American community organizations, local churches, and the YMCA who had wanted a radio station but who had lost out when Congress limited the LPFM service. In Omaha, the voices of these leaders meant a lot to Congressman Terry. He agreed to cosponsor the bill, and we had a bill to expand LPFM that was viable. Once we saw this formula work, we just kept the turntable spinning with local variations on the same theme. We refreshed and maintained connections with new and former LPFM applicants at community radio station “barnrais- ings”—an event taken from the Amish tradition of communities coming together to build a barn in a day or two—where we build an entire LPFM radio station over the weekend. We moved through legislative cycles, getting a little further each time. Each breakthrough with a legislator was a small, nour- ishing victory that allowed us to keep going. Our allies in the Senate patiently moved the bill forward each session until they reached a ceiling and then we would try again. As the years went by, our “DC drag” got threadbare and sometimes our spirits did too. We got tired and angry when allies described our campaign as “low-hanging fruit” in the ﬁght for media reform. We got exhausted explaining why National Public Radio and the big, conservative, commercial broadcasters at the National Association of Broadcasters were\nworking together to kill our little stations.\nWe hit something of a turning point in 2005. When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts and other parts of the Gulf,\n \ncommunications systems broke down for millions. Of the forty-two radio stations lining the Gulf coast, only four mostly stayed on the air during the storm—and two of those were LPFM radio stations. WQRZ-LP in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, was so important for helping the Hancock County resi- dents ﬁnd shelter, family members, and resources that the local emergency services agencies invited them to set up shop with them and broadcast hyper- local emergency information along with the Zydeco and other local music that comforted survivors’ frayed nerves.\nTelling that story expanded our coalition further, bringing in emergency services leaders together with civil rights, social justice, libertarian, and right- and-left religious organizations all pushing for LPFM radio. After the wave of new Congress members in 2008, we were able to move bills through the House and Senate much more quickly. But we were working against time, as well. While 91.5 percent of Americans continued to rely on radio at least once every week (Radio Advertising Bureau 2014) LPFM advocates increasingly had to contend with statements like “Doesn’t everyone have an iPhone now?” and “Why does radio matter?” We continued to get hundreds of calls a week from radio hopefuls including speakers of Hmong and Haitian Creole, students and seniors, pastors and parents. We knew however that our time was running out with Congress increasingly interested in shiny new things.\nBy December 2010, the campaign for LPFM had reached a make-or-break junction. We were burning out as a result of years of hitting our heads against intractable opponents and a do-nothing Congress. We were just days from the end of the legislative session, and if we did not pass our bill through the Senate, we would have to start from scratch in the new year. Our bill had passed the House, and passed the appropriate communications-focused subcommittee and committee in the Senate. It was up for “unanimous consent” in the Senate.\nOur opponents at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), led by former Republican Senator Gordon Smith, were stopping our bill using a series of anonymous holds by Senators in red states. In order to break a hold like this, we had to discover who was behind it, then mobilize constituents, create public pressure and local press stories in the state until the Senators’ staﬀ buckled and released the hold.\nWe had little time to act—maybe two weeks before legislators went home for Christmas and closed all pending bills, which would have to be rebooted from scratch the next session. Experienced lobbyists advised us that we were better oﬀ hanging it up and trying again next session. We needed to turn up the pressure. This was very divisive in our group. Some of us felt we would lose all the legitimacy we had built up if we made fools of ourselves for nothing. But what was all that legitimacy for anyway, if we didn’t win?\nDanielle Chynoweth, the leader who had built WRFN-LP in Urbana, Illi- nois, and a seasoned campaigner who joined our team for the last years of the\n \ncampaign, came up with the idea of a hula hoop demonstration. We called our friends who could juggle, do ﬂips and splits, and were willing to “clown around” to help create a makeshift circus in front of the NAB’s national head- quarters. Our goal was to bring attention to the circus the NAB was making out of American democracy with their dirty Senate procedural tricks and insider string-pulling. Our slogan was “Stop making low-power FM radio jump through so many hoops!” (see Figure 14–1).\nThe demonstration was a success. The NAB locked their front doors, letting no one in or out of the building for an hour, clearly concerned that we might take over their lobby with our hooping. We got a ton of press, and thousands of people watched a three-minute video we made of the event. The decisive story was an article in Politico (Martinez 2010). The reporter not only inter- viewed us and the NAB, but also other organizations that were having similar issues with the NAB at the same time, such as the cable industry and the music licensing industry. They echoed our claim that the NAB was using dirty politi- cal tricks—a move that deﬁnitely helped our cause.\nThe NAB surrendered two days later, and on January 6, 2011, President Obama signed the bill that would expand community radio to thousands of communities nationwide. The bill lifted the restrictions that made it impossible to apply for licenses in cities, making it possible that most moderate-sized cities would have at least four or ﬁve channels available, and even the densest markets (like here in Philadelphia) would have one or two. It was one of the biggest victories for media reform in a generation, passing new regulations and a bill through Congress that will lead to thousands of new media outlets in the hands of ordinary people around the country.\nKeep it tuned to your radio dial. Looking forward to another generation of struggle.\n\n\nFIGURE 14-1. LPFM activists demonstrating outside of the National Association of Broadcasters.\n \nLESSONS LEARNED \nFive lessons we learned from the ﬁght for LPFM radio in the United States:\n\n1.\tThere’s no replacement for a passionate grassroots eﬀort that wants to build something. Even though Prometheus was a tiny outﬁt working out of a two-room church basement, we were able to harness the power of people who felt robbed of the community radio they needed.\n2.\tLocal voices with meaningful stories will be heard. We encouraged people to share detailed, speciﬁc, personal stories with legislators about how their community could use a radio station. In a crowded Washing- ton DC, with big corporate media lobbyists shaking hands and sharing meals with our elected representatives, we found that stories about local issues spoke louder than the richest broadcasters in the world.\n3.\tChange takes time. It took our grassroots eﬀorts ten years to get a pro- public interest correction through. Ten years is like forever in the cur- rent environment of technological change, so choose your issues wisely.\n4.\tIf you ﬂit from hot topic to hot topic, you will never win. Industry always has its insider advantages in the short term. Choose campaigns well, campaigns that will keep on making a diﬀerence in long term, and stick with them long enough to win them.\n5.\tCommunity-building events strengthen movements for the long haul. If we can come together outside of campaign work—outside of calling Congress, signing petitions, taking action—we will build a more per- manent understanding of each other across communities, race, and class, that is, the lines that divide us and keep big media strong.\n\nPrometheus kept the LPFM radio movement vibrant by bringing together practitioners, hopefuls, and friends for “radio barnraisings”—events that brought together communities to build a radio station over the course of a weekend—hand pulling a donated radio tower up to its full height in rural Tennessee; at the top of water towers in Woodburn, Oregon, and in the ﬁelds with strawberry pickers. Radio barnraisings included the construction of a studio, over forty workshops on radio technology, politics, content and opera- tions, and erecting the antenna. In addition to the physical construction of the station, radio news stories and announcements were edited, organizing meet- ings were held, and live radio dramas were performed during the ﬁrst broadcast of the new station on Sunday night before everyone went home. We built LPFM radio stations, and a movement that fought and won media reform.\n\n"

It details the efforts of the Prometheus Radio Project in overcoming major corporate resistance and achieving legislative success for LPFM.\n\n1. **Grassroots Passion**: The success of the LPFM campaign, driven by a small team from a humble beginning, was buoyed by the collective power of people who felt disenfranchised and wanted to reclaim community radio.\n\n2. **Local Stories Matter**: Personal anecdotes and community narratives proved much more influential than corporate lobbying when presented to lawmakers, emphasizing the value of LPFM for local issues.\n\n3. **Long-Term Commitment**: Realizing meaningful media reform can take years; therefore, dedication to the cause is crucial. Campaigns must be chosen carefully to ensure their relevance and impact endure over time.\n\n4. **Focus on Permanent Change**: Fleeting issues won't lead to lasting victories. By maintaining a long-term perspective, reform movements can achieve goals that continue to benefit the public even amidst rapid technological transformations.\n\n5. **Building a Stronger Community**: Outside of direct campaign work, fostering bonds among activists strengthens the movement's foundation, creating a more resilient push against the forces that strengthen big media corporations.\n\n#### THE PROMETHEUS RADIO PROJECT\nPrometheus Radio Project arose from the pirate radio movement, where activists, in response to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and ensuing media consolidation, took to the airwaves to create diverse, community-focused broadcasting. As a result of grassroots activism and engagement with the FCC, the LPFM service was conceived, granting licenses to community groups for hyper-local radio stations. This decision, however, faced opposition from major broadcasters, leading to a ten-year struggle, culminating in the Legislative victory of the Local Community Radio Act, signed by President Obama in January 2011, which expanded LPFM into urban areas.\n\n#### LESSONS LEARNED\nThe chapter's reflective approach distills key strategies responsible for Prometheus's success, underlining the effectiveness of genuine grassroots activism, coupled with compelling narratives and extended perseverance. These insights are valuable for understanding how small, passionate groups can execute impactful media reform, influencing laws and regulations in favor of community empowerment and diversification of the media landscape. The emphasis on cultivating a sense of closeness and unity within the movement highlights the importance of solidarity in driving sustainable change.\n\n#### PROMETHEUS'S JOURNEY AND IMPACT\nThe narrative celebrates Prometheus Radio Project's ability to bridge communities, harness the collective desire for expression, and navigate political landscapes. The triumph over the National Association of Broadcasters exemplifies the power of grassroots mobilization and challenges the political status quo. The recount of community-building events such as radio barnraisings underlines the transformative potential of collective action in media reform goals."
