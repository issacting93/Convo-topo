Each character originates from different game series: Sash Lilac from \"Freedom Planet\" and Spyro from the \"Spyro the Dragon\" series. Consequently, there is no official information or lore regarding their hypothetical offspring."

However, in the realm of fan fiction or creative fan interpretations, one could imagine various possibilities for their children. These could include characters with traits and abilities inherited from both Sash Lilac and Spyro, resulting in unique hybrid powers and personalities. Ultimately, any depiction of their potential children would be left up to the imagination of the fans."
