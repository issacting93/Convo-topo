But we need to choose one or more vocabulary learning strategies that suit us based on our specific situation in order to improve learning efficiency. Therefore, we need to deeply study the application of current vocabulary learning strategies for English majors, and enrich the scope of vocabulary learning strategies to improve students' learning efficiency. Therefore, in my paper, it is important to investigate the current status of vocabulary learning strategies used by English majors and how they are more effective than other strategies.",

These insights are critical to our ongoing research on vocabulary acquisition. However, selecting the most effective strategy that suits our individual needs is key to improving learning efficiency. As such, a thorough examination of the current vocabulary learning strategies available to English majors is necessary to enhance their vocabulary acquisition and optimize learning outcomes. In this regard, this paper aims to explore the current status of vocabulary learning strategies employed by English majors, with the ultimate objective of identifying the most effective strategies in comparison to other approaches.",
