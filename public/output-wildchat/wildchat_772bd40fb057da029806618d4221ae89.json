      "content": "Make up a new D&D 5e feat called \"Bottom-Heavy\". Humanoids with this feat have their thighs, hips and buttocks balloon to absurd sizes, the bottom half of their bodies swelling several times larger than the rest of themselves. The feat is even more pronounced on halflings and gnomes, who despite being half the size of humans, have their bottom halves match that of Bottom-Heavy humans, making them nearly quadruple in size below the waist, and only below the waist."

      "content": "Feats in D&D 5e often grant players new abilities or enhance their characters in some way. Below is the new homebrew feat \"Bottom-Heavy.\" Players interested in including this unusual feature in their game must remember that D&D is a collaborative storytelling game, and features that affect a character's physical form, particularly in this exaggerated manner, should be discussed with the Dungeon Master and the gaming group to ensure that it fits the tone and content of the campaign.\n\n**Bottom-Heavy**\n\n*Prerequisite: Humanoid*\n\nYour character has an unusually proportioned physique, with your lower half vastly oversized in comparison to the rest of your body. Gnomes and halflings with this trait have it even more pronounced. Living with such a unique condition has granted you a number of benefits:\n\n- **Enhanced Stability:** You have advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws against effects that would knock you prone.\n\n- **Powerful Lower Limbs:** Your Jump distance is doubled, and you do not need to move before making a long jump.\n\n- **Immovable Stance:** You have advantage on checks and saves to resist being moved against your will.\n\n- **Natural Cushioning:** When you take damage from falling, you can use your Reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to five times your character level.\n\n- **Squat Power:** As an action, you can leap to cause a tremor. Every creature within 5 feet of the point where you land must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be knocked prone.\n\nIn addition, your carrying capacity and the amount of weight you can push, drag, or lift are doubled.\n\nNotably, though some of these abilities might seem advantageous, your unusual physique might also attract attention or present challenges:\n\n- **Cumbersome:** Your movement speed is reduced by 5 feet due to the disproportionate weight.\n\n- **Fitting In:** Squeezing through spaces smaller than your size category may require special DM adjudication and could potentially be more challenging for you than other characters.\n\n- **Custom Gear:** Armor and clothing for your lower body costs twice as much due to the additional materials required. \n\n- **Overbalancing:** When attempting to use equipment designed for creatures of standard proportions (such as ladders, chairs, or mounts), DM discretion is advised to determine any potential complications or additional checks required.\n\nRemember that any homebrew content, feats included, should be agreed upon by the gaming group and balanced to ensure a fun and fair experience for all players."

      "content": "In Dungeons & Dragons 5e, feats generally do not directly modify ability scores. Instead, they offer unique abilities or enhance existing ones. The Bottom-Heavy feat as described focuses on conferring unique benefits and challenges based on the character's disproportionate physique. However, it could indirectly affect gameplay in various ways that aren't strictly numerical.\n\nHere's how the Bottom-Heavy feat might affect the character outside of the explicit benefits and complications I've already detailed:\n\n**Social Interactions:**\n- Characters with this trait might draw a lot of attention in social situations, which could lead to unique role-playing opportunities or challenges. For instance, it might make them famous in certain circles, the butt of jokes, or even discriminated against due to their extraordinary appearance.\n- Some NPCs might be fascinated or intimidated by the character's physique, which could influence social encounters.\n\n**Mobility in Confined Spaces:**\n- A Bottom-Heavy character could find it particularly difficult to navigate through tight dungeons, crawlspaces, or dense forests, which might require creative problem-solving from the player and their party.\n- Certain modes of transport, such as conventional horses or small boats, might be unsuitable or require special accommodations.\n\n**Environmental Interactions:**\n- In some environments, the character’s unusual size could be a benefit (e.g., wading through deep water or snow), while in others it could be a detriment (e.g., moving across thin ice or trying to hide).\n- Some traps or environmental hazards might be harder for the character to avoid, but they might also be able to trigger and withstand certain traps that others cannot.\n\n**Combat Considerations:**\n- In combat, the character’s size could provide cover for smaller allies or hinder enemy movement.\n- However, the same trait might make the character an easier target for certain attacks or effects that target an area or require a Dexterity saving throw. \n\n**Storytelling and World Interaction:**\n- The character's unique appearance could be integral to their backstory and affect how they interact with the world. For example, they might seek out a specific tailor or blacksmith who caters to their unique needs.\n- Legends or prophecies might exist within the game world that either feature or foretell the coming of a character with such an unusual trait, which could integrate into the larger narrative of the campaign.\n\nWhile the Bottom-Heavy feat does not directly alter ability scores, it does provide a range of narrative and mechanical implications that can deeply affect the character’s experiences in the game.\n\nIf a DM wished to include a change to ability scores as part of the Bottom-Heavy feat, they might consider something like this:\n\n- **Strong, but Unwieldy:** Your Constitution score increases by 1, as your body has adapted to carrying the extra weight, but due to your disproportionate balance, your Dexterity score decreases by 1.\n\nHowever, this would represent a divergence from the standard design of 5e feats, which often avoid lowering ability scores, and such a change should only be implemented with careful consideration and group consent."
