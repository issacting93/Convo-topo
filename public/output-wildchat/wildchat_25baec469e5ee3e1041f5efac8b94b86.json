      "content": "As a massive storm tears through the world of Minecraft, a strange dragon unlike any other descends. Once the storm dissipates, the elder dragon “Amatsumagatsuchi” reveals his true self. He stares down at a large cavern, where a strange sight catches his eye - five different girls, unlike any Amatsumagatsuchi has seen. He descends upon the girls, and sees that each girl’s clothes resemble a different type of monster that inhabits the Minecraft world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze. Amatsumagatsuchi just looks at them, and notices that the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton was in pain - and her stomach was swollen. The other girls - introducing themselves as Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazette - later introduce their friend Ayumi. Amatsumagatsuchi looks into Ayumi’s eyes - and, despite the intense pain, Ayumi looks back at Amatsumagatsuchi. As the Monster Hunter world was destroyed by Xyza - who had seemingly crossed over from the Gigabash world to the Monster Hunter world - Amatsumagatsuchi had to find a new place to live. However, his mystical energy somehow found its way to Ayumi - even though the two didn’t meet back then. Amatsumagatsuchi then gently puts his tail on Ayumi’s forehead, and received several flashbacks - such as Ayumi finding her weapon of choice (which was a bow and quiver full of arrows), and Ayumi having unexplained sickness as her stomach emitted winds that Amatsumagatsuchi was also accompanied by during his descent, and one flashback even showed Ayumi’s stomach rapidly growing. The final flashback that Amatsumagatsuchi received showed Ayumi getting a scan of her stomach - and the scan showed what looks like a hybrid of human and…the Amatsumagatsuchi himself. None of the flashbacks made sense to Amatsumagatsuchi - what was going on? And why was Ayumi in pain? Could the flashbacks mean that Ayumi is pregnant with Amatsumagatsuchi’s baby? Amatsumagatsuchi gently puts his tail on Ayumi’s stomach. To everyone’s shock, Ayumi’s stomach returns to normal - and the pain seems to have…stopped.\n\n\n(There would be dialogue between each character)"

But why did her stomach suddenly go back to normal?\"\n\nBlazette: \"And what's with those flashbacks that dragon received? They seemed like they were about Ayumi.\"\n\nVanessa: \"Could it be that Ayumi is carrying the dragon's child?\"\n\nAyumi, blushing: \"W-what?! No, that's impossible!\"\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, staring at Ayumi: \"But the flashbacks showed…\"\n\nAyumi, looking down: \"I don't know. I've been feeling sick for a while now, but I never thought it could be because of anything like that.\"\n\nCupa, looking concerned: \"Ayumi, we should take you to a doctor and get you checked out.\"\n\nAndr, nodding: \"Agreed. We need to make sure you're okay.\"\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, still looking at Ayumi: \"I will stay with her. I must know the truth.\"\n\nThe group agrees to take Ayumi to a doctor, while Amatsumagatsuchi stays behind to keep an eye on her. As they leave the cavern, Ayumi can't help but wonder - could she really be carrying the child of a dragon from another world? And if she is, what does that mean for her future?"

Ayumi hasn’t gone into labor despite being 40 weeks pregnant - which would’ve happened any day now. Cupa begins reading about the elder dragons, and her research on the Amatsumagatsuchi page is surprising - an Amatsumagatsuchi can only be born during intense storms, just like the storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa. Amatsumagatsuchi tries to create a storm to help Ayumi with her journey to motherhood, but nothing happens. Amatsumagatsuchi just stares in confusion - where had his powers gone? Amatsumagatsuchi looks at the corpse of Xyva - a reminder of victory. Just as hope seems lost, the storm serpents arrive - and with them, an extremely intense storm. While the storm serpents are completely oblivious to the storms they create, the severity of Ayumi’s contractions was clear - it was finally time for her to give birth.\n\n\n(There would be dialogue between each character)"

But something's not working right...\"\n\nAyumi, looking at Amatsumagatsuchi: \"It's okay. You're here with me, and that's all that matters.\"\n\nAs the storm rages on outside, Ayumi gives birth to a healthy baby girl. The group celebrates the new addition to their family, while Amatsumagatsuchi looks on in awe. He never thought he would have a child, let alone one that is half-human.\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, looking at the baby: \"She's beautiful. What should we name her?\"\n\nAyumi, smiling through tears: \"I've always liked the name Hikari. It means 'light', and she has brought so much light into our lives.\"\n\nThe group agrees, and Hikari is welcomed into their family with open arms. As they sit together, watching the storm rage outside, Amatsumagatsuchi can't help but feel grateful for the unexpected turn his life has taken. He may have lost his powers, but he gained something much more valuable - a family."

Vanessa says that she had a one-night-stand with a human-spider thing named “Arachnus”, but doesn’t recall much about the encounter. This was sudden to Amatsumagatsuchi - Ayumi had just recently had a child in the form of Arashi, so how come Vanessa’s starting to feel sick all of a sudden? And who was this “Arachnus” guy? The next day, Ayumi and Amatsumagatsuchi bring Vanessa to a healer. They were hoping to find a cause to Vanessa’s sudden sickness, but the response was unexpected to say the least.\n\n\n(There would be dialogue between each character)"

It was just one night, and then he was gone.\"\n\nHealer: \"It's not uncommon for interactions between beings of different species to result in unexpected pregnancies. But you need to take care of yourself and the baby, Vanessa.\"\n\nCupa, looking worried: \"How are we going to take care of two babies at once? And what if there are more unexpected pregnancies?\"\n\nAndr, looking at Amatsumagatsuchi: \"Do you think something is causing these strange pregnancies?\"\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, looking deep in thought: \"I'm not sure. But we need to figure this out before anything else happens.\"\n\nAs they leave the healer's chamber, the group starts to piece together the strange occurrences. They all knew that the Minecraft world was full of unexpected surprises, but this was something else entirely. They were going to need to work together and use all their resources if they were going to solve this mystery."

      "content": "A few weeks go by, and Cupa starts noticing something new in Vanessa’s room of the castle - cobwebs, and lots of them. Although Vanessa was dressed like a Cave Spider, she actually has the same reproductive cycle of a regular spider - she lays eggs instead of having live young. And judging from the size of Vanessa’s stomach, she was going to have a lot of eggs. A few months later, Vanessa starts feeling a ton of scurrying in her stomach - all 20 of the eggs had hatched, despite the fact they were still in her stomach. However, Vanessa can’t actually give birth until an extremely vicious elder dragon called the Nergigante enters the vicinity - the only problem is that the Nergigante species went extinct a long time ago. And since the anatomy of a Nergigante’s biology is so complex, its currently impossible to replicate the power of one, and the only known prey of the Nergigante is weaker elder dragons like Teostra or Chameleos - not Amatsumagatsuchi. As a result, Vanessa wouldn’t be able to welcome all 20 of her children into the world at all - as Amatsumagatsuchi and the storm serpents are the only living Elder Dragons.\n\n\n(There would be dialogue between each character)"

How is this even happening?\"\n\nBlazette: \"And with all those cobwebs, I'm guessing you're not just a Cave Spider costume-wearing girl.\"\n\nVanessa, nodding: \"I actually have the same reproductive cycle as a spider. I lay eggs instead of having live young.\"\n\nAyumi, looking concerned: \"But that's a lot of eggs. How are you going to handle them all?\"\n\nVanessa, looking worried: \"Actually, that's the problem. I can't give birth until a Nergigante enters the vicinity. But since they went extinct a long time ago, there's no way for me to welcome all my children into the world.\"\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, looking grave: \"This is a serious issue. Since I'm one of the only living Elder Dragons, I can't risk fighting a Nergigante. And the anatomy of their biology is so complex, it's currently impossible to replicate their power.\"\n\nCupa, looking at Vanessa: \"We'll figure something out. We won't leave you to handle this alone.\"\n\nAndr, nodding: \"Agreed. We'll find a way to help you, Vanessa.\"\n\nBlazette: \"We may not have the power of a Nergigante, but we'll do everything we can to support you and your children.\"\n\nAs they sit together, trying to figure out a solution, the group realizes that they are all each other has.

The Elder Dragon “Velkhana” is also called “The Iceborne Wyvern”, and those that enter her freezing aura are known to suffer extreme frostbite. However, this freezing aura is also known to speed up birthing processes - as seen when one of Blazette’s closest friends, Jelli (who’s clothing resembles the Slime), was struggling to bring her own child into the world. The only thing is that Velkhana has made her home in the coldest reaches of the Minecraft world, and the tundra is no place that a blaze would want to go - as their bodies would be turned to ice. So, either Andr or Amatsumagatsuchi would have to bring Velkhana over to see Vanessa.\n\n\n(There would be dialogue between each character)"

It'll be a dangerous journey for any of us to go there.\"\n\nAndr: \"I can go. My body is used to the cold, and I've faced many dangerous creatures before.\"\n\nAmatsumagatsuchi, looking at Andr: \"I can't let you do this alone. I'll come with you.\"\n\nAyumi, looking worried: \"But what about Hikari? Who's going to take care of her?\"\n\nVanessa, stepping forward: \"I'll take care of her. I need to stay here anyway.\"\n\nCupa, nodding: \"Okay. We'll stay here and make sure everything is safe while you're gone.\"\n\nAs Andr and Amatsumagatsuchi prepare for their journey, they knew the risks. The cold was dangerous, but they had to do it for Vanessa and her children. After a perilous journey, they finally reach Velkhana's territory. Andr was able to withstand the cold due to his resilience, while Amatsumagatsuchi relied on his natural ability to produce heat. With their combined strength, they were able to bring Velkhana back to Vanessa's castle.\n\nAs Velkhana's freezing aura filled the room, Vanessa went into labor. The aura indeed sped up the birthing process, and soon all 20 of her children were born. It was a chaotic moment, but in the end, all of the children were healthy and happy.\n\nAs they all sit together, holding the new babies, the group knew that they had accomplished something amazing. They had overcome incredible obstacles and worked together to achieve a common goal. As they all marvel at the new additions to their family, they couldn't help but feel grateful for each other and the power of their bonds."
