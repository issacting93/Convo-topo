She is dressed in comfortable pajamas, happily munching on a bag of chips.\n\nANDREA, Jane's older sister in her early twenties, enters the room. She looks worried, biting her lower lip. Her eyes are puffy as if she had been crying.\n\nANDREA\n(softly)\nHey, Jane.\n\nJane looks up from her comic book, noticing Andrea's distressed state.\n\nJANE\n(concerned)\nHey, what's wrong, Andrea? You look upset.\n\nANDREA\n(sighs)\nI just got back from the doctor, and... it's not good news, Jane.\n\nJane's eyes widen, her concern deepening.\n\nJANE\n(putting her comic book aside)\nWhat happened? Are you okay?\n\nANDREA\n(teary-eyed)\nPhysically, I'm fine. But... the doctor told me I'm infertile.\n\nJane's mouth drops open, completely taken by surprise.\n\nJANE\n(taken aback)\nWhat? But, you're young! How is that even possible?\n\nANDREA\n(struggling to hold back tears)\nIt's a condition, Jane. I do have some eggs, but they're so few and far between, and the ones I have are incapable of producing babies.\n\nJane jumps off her bed and pulls Andrea into a tight embrace.\n\nJANE\n(whispering)\nOh, Andrea. I'm so sorry. I can't even begin to imagine how you must be feeling.\n\nANDREA\n(choked up)\nIt's... devastating, Jane. I always dreamed of having a family, but now it feels like that may never happen.\n\nJane pulls away slightly, looking directly into Andrea's eyes.\n\nJANE\n(sincerely)\nDon't lose hope, Andrea. There are other ways to build a family. Adoption, surrogacy, or even exploring other alternatives... We can research and find the best options together. You're not alone in this.\n\nAndrea's eyes well up again, this time with tears of gratitude.\n\nANDREA\n(sniffling)\nThank you, Jane. I'm really lucky to have you as my sister.\n\nJANE\n(sincerely)\nAnd I'm lucky to have you too, Andrea. We'll face this challenge together, no matter what.\n\nAndrea manages a small smile, feeling slightly reassured by Jane's support.\n\nANDREA\n(softly)\nI love you, little sis.\n\nJANE\n(whispering)\nI love you too, Andrea. And we'll figure this out, I promise.\n\nThey stay embraced for a moment longer, finding solace in each other's presence, as they prepare to navigate the uncertain road ahead.\n\nFADE OUT.",

She taps her fingers against her leg, feeling the rhythm.\n\nANDREA, Jane's older sister in her early twenties, enters the room. She looks visibly upset, her eyes red and puffy. Andrea takes a deep breath, mustering the courage to talk to Jane.\n\nANDREA\n(sighs)\nJane, can I talk to you about something?\n\nJane pulls out her earbuds and sits up, concerned by Andrea's serious tone.\n\nJANE\n(softly)\nOf course, Andrea. What's wrong?\n\nANDREA\n(teary-eyed)\nI went to see a specialist today, Jane, and... I found out that I'm infertile.\n\nJane's eyes widen in shock, her mouth forming an \"O\" of surprise.\n\nJANE\n(whispering)\nOh, Andrea... I'm so sorry. That must be really hard for you.\n\nANDREA\n(nods)\nYeah, it's incredibly tough. The doctors said I have a few eggs, but they're far apart and unable to produce babies.\n\nJane instinctively reaches out, taking Andrea's hand in hers.\n\nJANE\n(sincerely)\nAndrea, you're not defined by your ability to have children. You're an amazing person who deserves happiness, with or without kids.\n\nAndrea's eyes well up with tears, touched by Jane's support.\n\nANDREA\n(sniffles)\nThank you, Jane. It's just... I always imagined having a family of my own someday. This news has shattered that dream.\n\nJane squeezes Andrea's hand reassuringly.\n\nJANE\n(gently)\nI understand your dream, Andrea. It's okay to grieve and feel disappointed right now. But just remember, there are other paths to motherhood, like adoption or surrogacy. Don't give up hope.\n\nAndrea lets out a shaky breath, her eyes searching Jane's for assurance.\n\nANDREA\n(voice trembling)\nYou really think those options could work?\n\nJane smiles warmly, offering her unwavering support.\n\nJANE\n(confidently)\nAbsolutely. We'll explore all the possibilities together, Andrea. We'll find a way to make your dream of motherhood come true.\n\nAndrea wipes away a tear and smiles, genuinely grateful for her sister's unwavering support.\n\nANDREA\n(whispering)\nThank you, Jane. I'm so lucky to have you by my side.\n\nJane gives Andrea a tight hug, enveloping her in a comforting embrace.\n\nJANE\n(emotional)\nAnd I'm lucky to have you as my sister. We'll face this journey together, no matter what it takes.\n\nThey hold onto each other tightly, finding strength in their bond as they prepare to navigate the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead.\n\nFADE OUT.",
