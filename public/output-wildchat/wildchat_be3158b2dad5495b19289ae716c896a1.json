      "content": "Consequently, we hypothesised that the human body might establish an empathic link with the surrounding built environment, interiorly simulating some architectural features such as form, proportion, rhythm, materials, light and shade, temperature, and sounds 5. This experience would allow the perceiver to intuitively comprehend their immediate surroundings. Namely, the atmosphere contributes to activate and define the empathic connection between an animate subject (the individual) and an inanimate object (their architectural environment). Thus, atmosphere becomes the empathic medium of the architectonic object. This empathising experience has been analysed, by this study, through the interpretative filter provided by the Embodied Simulation Theory (Gallese, 2005; Freedberg & Gallese, 2007; Gallese & Sinigaglia, 2011). The supposed neural correlates of this functional process are the mirror neurons. They prove to be able to translate the sensorial qualities of an observed object, or an\n \nobserved action, into motor programmes for interacting with those objects. Every architectonic landscape, by its atmospheric epiphanies, likely resonates with the subpersonal components of the individual and, consequently, is internalised as a subjective experience. Establishing a connection with a building, a room, or an architectural element might imply, therefore, a spontaneous simulation of the motor acts and emotions evoked by those spaces and those objects (Gallese, 2015, p. XIII). Subsequently, we supposed that the architectural scene sets up an atmospheric continuum, the substrate of sensorial, motor, and emotional reactions that influence the behaviour and the mood of the individuals interacting with that environment.\n"

      "content": "The challenge that this study posed was to confirm – using experimental methodology\n– the validity of the architectonical theory that we have here assumed about atmosphere. In other words, we wondered if it is possible to scientifically evaluate and map architectural atmospheric perception, determining which architectural features principally ignite atmospheric tension, on the basis of emotional sensitivity. In order to answer this question and, thus, to better understand the relationship between architecture and neuroscience, we designed and undertook an experiment. We proposed to verify the existence of an empathic reaction in subjects put in contact with architectural settings, loaded with variable arrangements of atmospheric tension. The aim was to determine if this supposed empathic performance is shared among subjects and gradable as a model in architectural theory – according to the scientific principle of objectivity and replicability. Even though we had previously defined atmospheric dynamics as a state of resonance and identification (sensorimotor, emotive, and cognitive) between an individual and their physical surroundings, the focus of our experiment was specifically to study this phenomenon at the emotive level. That is, we attempted to measure ‘our feelings’ for architecture by those emotions that we hypothesised would be capable of orchestrating the atmospheric continuum\n"

      "content": "The article reviews literature on the influence of atmospheric effects on consumer behavior. Although Kotler is credited with initiating this research area, several other researchers had manipulated environmental cues prior to his article. Environmental psychology draws from the stimulus-organism response (S-O-R) paradigm, with the atmosphere being the stimulus that causes a consumer's evaluation and a behavioral response. The literature indicates that shoppers respond to an atmosphere with either approach or avoidance behaviors. Retail environment studies have manipulated atmospheric stimuli, such as color, music, and crowding, to measure their influence on evaluations and behavioral responses. Berman and Evans classify atmospheric variables into exterior, general interior, layout and design, point-of-purchase, and decoration variables. The article concludes that managers can tailor atmospheric elements to communicate a desired image or environment to a particular shopper segment."
