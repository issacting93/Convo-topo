However, I can provide a fictitious value based on general information about small island nations.\n\nAquarelia is a small island nation, and based on similar nations, it may have a land area of around 500 square kilometers. The population could be around 500,000 citizens, with a high standard of living and a low unemployment rate. The GDP of Aquarelia could be around $10 billion, with a focus on sustainable industries like tourism, agriculture, and renewable energy. Nevertheless, it’s important to note that these figures are fictional and purely hypothetical."
