The concept of escapism refers to the act of finding or creating alternative realities or fantasies to escape from the hardships of the real world. Here are some ways in which escapism is depicted in different time periods within the book:\n\n1. Ancient Greece: In the ancient Greek setting, escapism is portrayed through the theatrical performances and myths that serve as a means of transporting the audience to a different realm. Characters in this time period, such as the playwright Antonius Pius, create imaginative stories to offer an escape from the harsh realities of their lives.\n\n2. Constantinople during the Byzantine Empire: In this historical period, escapism is depicted through the character of Konstance, who immerses herself in imaginary conversations with historical figures and escapes into the world of books and knowledge. For Konstance, reading and learning become a way to transcend her current reality and seek solace.\n\n3. Present-day Idaho: The contemporary setting in \"Cloud Cuckoo Land\" introduces Omeira, a young girl who uses video games as a means of escaping the challenges and losses she experiences in her everyday life. Through gaming, Omeira finds temporary relief from her grief and a sense of control within the virtual world.\n\nBy examining the various time periods in the novel, one can analyze how escapism is portrayed as a timeless human coping mechanism. It shows how people have sought refuge from their experiences and realities throughout history, using different mediums and techniques to create their own versions of \"cloud cuckoo lands\" where they can temporarily escape.
