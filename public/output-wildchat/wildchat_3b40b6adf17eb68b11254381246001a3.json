The contribution margin is the selling price per unit minus the variable cost per unit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the contribution margin per unit:\nContribution Margin per Unit = Selling Price per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit\nContribution Margin per Unit = $41 - $25\nContribution Margin per Unit = $16\n\nNext, we calculate the break-even point in units:\nBreak-Even Point (Units) = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin per Unit\nBreak-Even Point (Units) = $100,000 / $16\nBreak-Even Point (Units) = 6250\n\nSo, Shock Electronics needs to sell 6,250 portable heaters to reach the break-even point."
