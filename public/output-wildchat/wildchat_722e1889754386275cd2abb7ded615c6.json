I am writing to request the decommission of the following old databases of BI 4.2 – Business Objects application as they have been taken offline for more than 2 weeks without reported issues:\n\n- [List of old databases to decommission]\n\nWe have carefully evaluated our current data storage needs, and have found that we no longer require these old databases. Therefore, we kindly request your assistance to decommission these databases completely, including the removal of all data, backups and related files.\n\nPlease let us know if there are any concerns or potential risks associated with the decommission. We are willing to provide additional information or assistance if needed.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.
