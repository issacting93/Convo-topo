Active ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide\n2. UV filters such as avobenzone, homosalate, or octinoxate\n3. Emollients and moisturizers such as aloe vera or glycerin\n4. Fragrances or essential oils for scent, but this may cause irritation in some individuals\n5. Preservatives to prevent the formula from going bad, such as parabens or phenoxyethanol. \n\nIt is important to check the ingredients list and SPF rating to ensure that the sunblock lotion provides adequate protection from harmful UV rays.",
