As shown in Fig. 14, the temperatures on the windward side of the skeleton are lower than those on the leeward side for all three structures. The streamlines of the metal foam structure are disorder whereas the streamlines of both the kelvin and weaire phelan structures are in order. As shown in Fig. 14 (a), the average temperature of the metal foam skeleton is the lowest, which is because at lower velocity, the fluid is able to fully contact and exchange heat with the metal foam due to the irregularity of the metal foam structure. At higher velocities, as shown in Fig. 14 (b), the overall temperatures of the three structures are similar. However, discontinuity in the velocity distribution of the metal foam and irregularity in the streamlines lead to the existence of dead zones for heat transfer. These areas appear as local high-temperature spots, leading to deterioration of heat transfer. The flow through the weaire phelan structure is faster than the kelvin structure and the weaire phelan structure is more irregular than the Kelvin structure. Therefore, weaire phelan structure also shows places where heat transfer is inadequate, affecting the heat transfer performance.\"",

      "content": "The difference in heat transfer performance of the metal foam is significant at velocities of 10m/s and 25m/s. To analyze this, we selected velocity contours, temperature contours, and a streamline diagram for three structures at these velocities (Fig. 14). It can be observed that the temperatures on the windward side of the skeleton are lower than those on the leeward side in all three structures. The metal foam structure exhibits disorderly streamlines, whereas both the Kelvin and Weaire-Phelan structures have orderly streamlines. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 14 (a), the average temperature of the metal foam skeleton is the lowest. This is due to the irregularity of the metal foam structure, which allows for full contact and heat exchange between the fluid and the metal foam at lower velocities. However, at higher velocities (Fig. 14 (b)), the overall temperatures of the three structures become similar. Nevertheless, the presence of dead zones for heat transfer is attributed to discontinuity in the velocity distribution of the metal foam and irregularity in the streamlines. These dead zones cause local high-temperature spots, leading to a deterioration of heat transfer. Furthermore, the flow through the Weaire-Phelan structure is faster than that through the Kelvin structure. The Weaire-Phelan structure also exhibits greater irregularity compared to the Kelvin structure. Consequently, the Weaire-Phelan structure also experiences inadequate heat transfer in certain areas, thereby affecting its heat transfer performance.\n\nTable of Modifications:\n\n| Sentence | Modifications | Reasons for Modifications |\n| -------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Because the difference in the heat transfer performance of the metal foam is large at 10m/s and 25m/s | No modification | N/A |\n| the velocity contours, temperature contours, and streamline diagram for three structures with velocities of 10m/s and 25m/s were selected for analysis | No modification | N/A |\n| As shown in Fig. 14, the temperatures on the windward side of the skeleton are lower than those on the leeward side for all three structures | Rewritten for clarity and conciseness | To improve readability and precision |\n| The streamlines of the metal foam structure are disorder whereas the streamlines of both the Kelvin and Weaire-Phelan structures are in order | Rewritten for clarity and conciseness | To improve readability and precision |\n| As shown in Fig. 14 (a), the average temperature of the metal foam skeleton is the lowest, which is because at lower velocity, the fluid is able to fully contact and exchange heat with the metal foam due to the irregularity of the metal foam structure | Rewritten for clarity and conciseness | To improve readability and precision |\n| At higher velocities, as shown in Fig. 14 (b), the overall temperatures of the three structures are similar | Rewritten for clarity and conciseness | To improve readability and precision |\n| However, discontinuity in the velocity distribution of the metal foam and irregularity in the streamlines lead to the existence of dead zones for heat transfer.
