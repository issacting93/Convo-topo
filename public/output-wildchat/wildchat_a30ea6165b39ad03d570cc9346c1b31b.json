Proceeds in Aid of the Lismore Hospital. Full particulars in future issue. TRAVERS R. GOFF, Hon. Sec.\"[7]\n\nTravers was branch manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank: He was at Moree, where he was involved in community events such as being an MC for the \"cinderella dance\" in aid of All Saints' Church of England in October 1895.[8]\n\nHe was playing cricket at Moree in 1893.[9]\n\nHe was a football umpire at Moree in 1896.[10]\n\nHe had instructions to close the Moree branch in 1896, and he was Branch Manager at Maryborough in 1896, 1900 at Ipswich, 1902 Brisbane, and finally in 1905 at Allora.[11]\n\nMarriage: Travers married Margaret Agnes Morehead on 9 November 1898 at All Saints' Church, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Margaret was the daughter of Robert Charles Morehead & Maria (Jacobs) Morehead.[12]\n\nTheir wedding announcement was in The Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday 19 November 1898:[13]\nThey had children:\n\n(1) Helen Lyndon Goff, b. 1899, d. 1996.[14]\n(2) Barbara Ierne (Biddy) Goff, b. 1902, d. 1979.[15]\n(3) Cicely Margaret (Moya) Goff, b. 1905, d. 1987.\n\n\n\nsummerize this with the same information and details (dont forget anything)"
