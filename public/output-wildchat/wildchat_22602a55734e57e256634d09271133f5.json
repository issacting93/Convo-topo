The phase shift of the graph is -π/6 units to the left, which corresponds to a horizontal translation.\n3. The amplitude of the secant function is undefined since it is always greater than or equal to 1.\n4. The secant function has vertical asymptotes where its denominator (cosine) equals zero. The equation 2x + π/3 = π/2 gives x = π/4 - π/6 = π/12 as the value that causes the cosine to be zero.\n5. The graph of y = sec(2x + π/3) is symmetric about the vertical line x = -π/3 since it is an even function.\n6.
