      "content": "To determine which statements are true about the graph of y = sec(2x + π/3), we can analyze the properties of the secant function and the given transformation.\n\n1. The period of the secant function is 2π/2 = π. So, the graph of y = sec(2x + π/3) will complete one full period in π units in the x-direction.\n2. The phase shift of the graph is -π/6 units to the left, which corresponds to a horizontal translation.\n3. The amplitude of the secant function is undefined since it is always greater than or equal to 1.\n4. The secant function has vertical asymptotes where its denominator (cosine) equals zero. The equation 2x + π/3 = π/2 gives x = π/4 - π/6 = π/12 as the value that causes the cosine to be zero.\n5. The graph of y = sec(2x + π/3) is symmetric about the vertical line x = -π/3 since it is an even function.\n6. The maximum and minimum values of the secant function are undefined since it can exceed any specified bound.\n\nTherefore, the statements that are true about the graph of y = sec(2x + π/3) are:\n\n1. The period of the graph is π.\n2. The graph is shifted π/6 units to the left.\n3. The graph has vertical asymptotes at x = -π/3 and x = π/3.\n4. The graph is symmetric about the line x = -π/3."
