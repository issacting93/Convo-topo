Standing at just 5’2”, Alex has always felt self-conscious about his height and has been teased by his peers for being “vertically challenged”. Despite trying various methods to increase his height, including stretching exercises and wearing platform shoes, nothing has worked for him. \n\nHis search for a miracle solution leads him to an online forum that discusses the use of illegal height-increasing products. The documentary delves into the details of these products and their potential effects on users. Alex learns that these products consist of a combination of peptides, amino acids, and growth hormones, which are banned by regulatory authorities due to their potential health risks.\n\nAlex connects with people who have used these products, and they share their experiences with him.

      "content": "As Alex searched for solutions to increase his height, he stumbled upon a website called “Grow Taller Forum”. The website had a wide community of people sharing their experiences regarding height-increasing supplements, including illegal products. The website allowed people from all over the world to connect with each other and seek guidance and advice from those who had previously used these products. Alex started reading threads, articles, and reviews from forum members who had used illegal height-increasing products and shared their progress, side effects, and potential dangers of using these products.\n\nSome of these forum members were also supplement companies in the height-increasing niche. They had to be discreet about their brand names and their products to avoid facing legal action by the FDA or the authorities. The forum members had aliases, and Alex connected with a few of them through one-on-one chat sessions. They shared detailed information and guidance on how to use the height-increase products, including the dosage, the timing, and the type of foods that would best supplement the potential height gain.\n\nThe website was not just a platform for those seeking solutions to increase their height. It was also a community that felt the societal pressures of height discrimination. The members shared endless stories of emotional distress, workplace discrimination, and the general difficulties of being shorter than the average height.\n\nHowever, it was clear from reading the posts and the threads that the use of these drugs was not widely accepted by society. Many forum members warned Alex of the potential dangers and side effects, and some even advised him to try other natural methods before following the path of using illegal products. The website was merely a platform for discussion and sharing experiences, and the creators did not promote or encourage the usage of illegal drugs or supplements for height gain.\n\nOverall, the documentary portrayed the potential dangers of the usage of illegal growth hormones, and the implications it has on a person’s health and life. The Grow Taller Forum provided a unique and anonymous space for individuals like Alex to explore these risks and learn from others’ experiences, but viewers were left warning of the dangers that come with seeking drastic measures to change one's body."

      "content": "In this alternative version of the documentary, Alex's search for a height-increasing solution leads him into the realm of genetic modification. After extensive research and reaching out to several geneticists, he discovers a highly experimental technique that claims to alter DNA and boost growth hormone production.\n\nThe documentary explores the science behind this process, as well as the ethical implications of such genetic manipulation. The procedure Alex undergoes involves injecting a CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme pair, allowing for the modification of the specific genes that dictate growth hormone production. He is also given a cocktail of supplements and hormones to support the modification process's smooth functioning.\n\nThe documentary explains how CRISPR-Cas9 works by effectively cutting and pasting genes to edit the DNA sequence in a targeted manner. Scientists have used this tool to eradicate numerous diseases and genetic mutations while also addressing infertility issues.\n\nAlex's genetic modification procedure takes place over a period of several months. Throughout this period, he undergoes frequent physical tests and bloodwork to monitor his modified gene expression's impact. The procedure requires Alex to take daily supplements, undertake a specific diet plan, and follow a physically challenging exercise routine.\n\nThe diet plan involves high-rich proteins with low levels of carbohydrates and fats. The exercise regimen targets the core and lower limb muscles, focusing on weight-bearing exercises like squats and deadlifts, and implementing spine-lengthening exercises.\n\nThe documentary depicts the scientific process of genetic modification and breaks it down into manageable bites for the layman to understand. It also illuminates the risks that are involved in an experimental procedure like this, ranging from unforeseen consequences and bleeding infections to the long-term ethical implications of genetic modification.\n\nThe procedure is not legal, and so Alex receives the treatment in an undisclosed location under the radar of regulatory authorities. The documentary raises the issue of the legality of the treatment and questions whether such procedures should be allowed for cosmetic purposes.\n\nAs the months pass, Alex does see results, including significant height gain. However, the documentary also reveals the downside of genetic modification, including the potential for the procedure to trigger mutations, leading to uncontrollable gene expression.\n\nIn conclusion, the documentary portrays the risks and rewards associated with genetic modification as a method for achieving drastic-height gain. Nevertheless, it raises crucial ethical and legal issues surrounding the technology's use for cosmetic purposes, highlighting the need for more research, regulation, and transparency to ensure such procedures are safe, legal, and effective."
