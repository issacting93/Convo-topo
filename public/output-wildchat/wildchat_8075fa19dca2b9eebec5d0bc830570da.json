Also, the episodes are available for viewing on 4kids' website as well as on DVD. I think it's a bit too soon to be airing the show again...but maybe that's just me, I'm not sure. :sad:\nCyberCubed\nWell-Known Member\nJoinedSep 25, 2004\nMessages11,300\nLocationNY\nMay 24, 2008\n#13\nTMNT on two different channels?\n\n4kids is crazy, as usual.\nSketch\nSketch\nnot like those other old guys\nJoinedFeb 26, 2002\nMessages66,869\nLocationWashington\nMay 24, 2008\n#14\nWell not THAT crazy. Actually I think this is a good strategy (assuming they aren't on at the same time). They will probably double slot Fast Forward on CW4kids in order to refresh the current TMNT viewers to lead-up to the new season in Fall. They also will be able to hook some viewers that didn't have 4kidsTV in their area but do have CW4kids. Though admitedly FF may not be good for hooking new viewers compared to the 2003 series on 4kidsTV but in the meantime they play 2003 episodes as a follow-up to the Ninja Tribunal because going from Tribunal to FF probably would feel a bit odd. But if they really are going to skip around then they'll probably hit the highlights of several seasons.\n\nThis way all of TMNT before Back to the Sewers gets showcased in some form. I don't know if I could sit through Fast Forward again but I can understand why they put it on CW4kids and had the 2003 series on 4kidsTV. If all goes according to plan TMNT should be able to gain a lot of viewers over the summer and have a strong season in 2008-2009 despite the movie being out of sight and out of mind (which we all know is the real reason FF got a ratings rise and why the Ninja Tribunal did as well as it did).\n\nI'm going to toss my hat in the direction of Tom and Jerry losing a slot as well. But Eon Kid is the weakest show in reruns right now I suppose (but it still has a few episodes it could show before it's over so I hope they at least do that). Spider-Man will keep two slots if it continues to do well in reruns. If not then it'll lose one. Skunk Fu might leave since it's coming to CN but they might keep it around because of Kung-Fu Panda. The 7 hour is going to stay the same I'm sure so I'll take a guess what the rest of the line-up will be when TMNT: FF joins.\n\n08:00 - Skunk Fu (or Johnny Test)\n08:30 - Tom and Jerry Tales\n09:00 - Tom and Jerry Tales (or World of Quest if two Spidey)\n09:30 - The Spectacular Spider-Man (or World of Quest if two T&J)\n10:00 - The Spectacular Spider-Man\n10:30 - Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward (CW4kids premiere)\n11:00 - Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward (CW4kids premiere)\n11:30 - Eon Kid (hopefully the final few episodes or World of Quest if two T&J and two Spidey or Skunk and JT both stay)\n\nNeedless to say, lots of variables but I'm very confident that Fast Forward will get an hour at least initially.\ncodyjones2105\nMember\nJoinedFeb 11, 2007\nMessages178\nLocationstrawtown\nMay 24, 2008\n#15\nSketch said:\nWell not THAT crazy.

That's a very good point you've made, and I now realize that this would definitely be good move to make, especially to attact more viewers to the Turtles. When I got to first reading this, I was thinking only about how much it had already been shown, and not about those who've never seen the series due to their area only having the CW, but not FOX, where the other 4kidsTV airs.\n\nI was into it for a little while, which was why I am still currently using this username I made up last year. Now I'm starting to catch up again with the 2k3 series, since I've been away from the Turtles for a long, long time and have never really seen all of it. The show I grew up with mostly was the 80s show, and that's still my favorite. :) I'm also quite excited about the new series in the Fall.\nDark Fact\nDark Fact\nPreaching evil since '04\nJoinedDec 5, 2004\nMessages15,233\nLocationTower of Dharm\nMay 24, 2008\n#16\nCartoonOverlord said:\nI just hope 4Kids doesn't pull The Spectacular Spider-Man off the schedule, that show's good and the only thing I watch on Kids WB! anymore.\nDoubtful.

I'm thinking it'll finish its initial run, but I'd be surprised if season 2 appears here in the States.\n\nI'm wondering if Skunk Fu is a possible survivor simply because of the upcoming film Kung Fu Panda movie.

Maybe they could come together and have more Gargoyles writers on Spectacular in Later seasons. That includes Marty Isenberg who actually wrote Future Tense. While Isenberg did not write SaiNW it's not too much of a stretch if he helped out.\n\nAlso why would that episode make Greg want to keep his distance? Because he made a comment that an episode like Future Tense could not be made today and then TMNT 2003 showed that it could? I would think he would be happy that he was wrong in that case.\n\nMovie06 said:\nOh, that's right.

As for why they're doubling Tom & Jerry and Spectacular Spider-Man, yes, it's because of ratings. That's how TV scheduling is dictated, so I guess you better get use to it as an excuse.\nLast edited by a moderator: May 24, 2008\nveemonjosh\nveemonjosh\nStone free, do what I please\nJoinedSep 30, 2005\nMessages28,860\nLocationThe Grid\nMay 24, 2008\n#31\nhobbyfan said:\nDid they cancel \"Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue\"?\n\nJust to clarify something, while it WAS canceled, you should be happy it at least got a proper series finale (actually, I love that WB actually took the time to give proper finales to ALL of their plot-centered shows that they canceled this year.

I do think that airing Fast Forword is a good move on their part. While that whole season aired like three times before and is already on DVD, it does give the people who haven't seen them on 4KidsTV a chance to see the most recent season before they head on with the new season this fall. I do agree that it might also be better if they aired some of the other seasons since that would give the viewers a better idea of the quality of TMNT, but hopefully the new season will show them that as well.\n\nI don't know which repeat slot they'll get rid of for this airing of Fast Forward.

The other 13 weren't scheuled to air until fall, but that is always subject to change since a different company has taken over the block. Also, summer is the time when reruns run rampant anyway, with the exception of CN, so it'll make no difference that they rerun a lot of episodes.\n\nThen again they could always surprise us and air TMNT Fast Forward from 9-10 replacing reruns of one slot of Spidey and T&JT, Also, I have the new lineup, Chaotic and YGOGX are coming and, you may wanna sit down. 3 out of the following are dead: Skunk Fu, Johnny Test, Eon Kid and World of Quest, Tomorrow I will tell you what's staying, Write the forum convo with him explaining this, and how we react"

      "content": "The introduction of CW4Kids, a 4Kids programming block on The CW network, brought about several changes and caused quite a stir among fans of the former Kids' WB lineup. The transition included new bumpers, a rebranded logo, and the integration of existing 4Kids shows alongside some remaining Kids’ WB content. This led to lively discussions about the new scheduling, the fate of beloved shows, and speculations on how the lineup might evolve in the future.\n\nIn a hypothetical scenario rooted in the enthusiastic exchanges among fans, the inclusion of Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX into CW4Kids would imply a significant shift towards 4Kids’ staple content, thus potentially overshadowing original Kids’ WB shows. The speculation about which series among Skunk Fu!, Johnny Test, Eon Kid, and World of Quest would continue airing reflects the uncertainties and mixed feelings fans experienced during this transitional phase.\n\nThe enthusiast's anticipation for new episodes and the scheduling of reruns, like TMNT: Fast Forward, underscores the desire for both continuity and refreshing content. Yet, the anticipation also brings about concerns on how beloved series would be treated under 4Kids’ stewardship, reflecting a broader discourse on the impact of broadcast changes on programming quality and viewer satisfaction.\n\nAs discussions unfold:\n1. Fans might express concern over repetitive reruns, especially for series like TMNT: Fast Forward, which had already seen extensive airtime.\n2. There could be a mix of excitement and skepticism about the inclusion of shows like Chaotic and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, based on their previous performances and reception in other blocks or networks.\n3. Speculation about which shows would be discontinued or relegated to less favorable time slots might dominate forums, as enthusiasts try to predict the new strategy of CW4Kids.\n4. Particular attention might be paid to how the block would balance between retaining Kids’ WB viewers and attracting a new audience with 4Kids’ specific branding and content.\n5. Concerns might be raised about the potential for creative interference in shows like The Spectacular Spider-Man, reflecting anxiety over how 4Kids’ influence might affect content direction and integrity.\n\nUltimately, this transition period represents a time of uncertainty, nostalgia, and cautious optimism among fans. The discussions, rumors, and official announcements all contribute to the communal processing of change, as viewers adjust their expectations and hope for a lineup that respects legacy content while introducing compelling new shows."

It seems we're losing some of our favorite shows. 😢\n\n**SpeedySketch**: Wait, what? Which shows are we talking about here? Skunk Fu!, Johnny Test, Eon Kid, and World of Quest? No way, I love those!\n\n**ToonFan4Life**: Seriously? They can't just drop all of those! There's gotta be at least one survivor. 😡\n\n**CartoonCrazeDude**: Any idea which one is staying, TurtlePower98? They all have their charm. I'm especially gonna miss World of Quest if that's going.\n\n**TurtlePower98**: Well, let me put you out of your misery. *Drumroll, please...* The survivor is... **Johnny Test**! 🎉 Looks like the adventures of our favorite boy genius aren't over yet.\n\n**MangaMaster**: Johnny Test, huh? I have mixed feelings about this. Glad one survived, but man, I was hoping for Skunk Fu! or World of Quest. 😕\n\n**AnimationNerd**: Johnny Test is like a cat with nine lives, haha. Guess it still pulls in the ratings for them.\n\n**PixelPirate**: I just hope they bring in some fresh episodes and not just reruns. Johnny could use some new adventures.\n\n**ToonFan4Life**: Bittersweet news, but thanks for the update, TurtlePower98. At least Johnny Test fans have something to look forward to. Here's hoping the others find a new home or at least release the episodes online. 🤞\n\n**TurtlePower98**: Agreed, ToonFan4Life. It's always tough to say goodbye to beloved shows, but who knows? Maybe with enough fan support, they'll reconsider or even revive them in some form. Let's keep our voices heard and hope for the best! And hey, let's give Johnny Test our support too. Who knows what kind of wacky experiments and adventures await? 🚀\n\n**SpeedySketch**: Appreciate the optimism, TurtlePower98. Let's not forget the fun times we had with the others. Meanwhile, Johnny Test, bring it on! And hey, maybe this will actually turn out better than we think. 🌟\n\n**CartoonCrazeDude**: Yeah, fingers crossed for all our favorites. In the meantime, let's rally behind Johnny and see where this new iteration of CW4Kids takes us. Thanks for the heads up, TurtlePower98! 👍\n\n**TurtlePower98**: Anytime, folks! Let's keep this forum alive with our love for cartoons, old and new. Here's to hoping CW4Kids surprises us in good ways in the upcoming seasons. Stay tooned, everyone! 📺"
