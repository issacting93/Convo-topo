      "content": "Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who\u2019s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren\u2019t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can\u2019t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 10 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily\u2019s because I\u2019m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 1 year and ages her by 1 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much Lily\u2019s increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn.\n\nMake the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily\u2019s stats should start at 10% of my stats.\n\nI will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty.\nOnly I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give a list of 20 spells we have access to (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them.",
