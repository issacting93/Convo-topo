      "content": "You can use the `excludes` configuration in the Surefire plugin to skip specific packages or test classes. Here's a sample configuration to skip a particular package that has a certain number of test classes. Replace `your.package.name` with the actual package name.\n\nAdd the following configuration to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<build>\n    <plugins>\n        <plugin>\n            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n            <version>3.0.0-M5</version>\n            <configuration>\n                <excludes>\n                    <exclude>**/your/package/name/*.java</exclude>\n                </excludes>\n            </configuration>\n        </plugin>\n    </plugins>\n</build>\n```\n\nThis configuration will exclude all `.java` files in the specified package. If you want to exclude test classes based on a certain pattern, you can modify the `exclude` element accordingly. For example, to exclude test classes with the word \"Integration\" in the name, you can do the following:\n\n```xml\n<excludes>\n    <exclude>**/*Integration*.java</exclude>\n</excludes>\n```\n\nRemember that this approach skips tests at runtime, and Maven has no direct configuration that can skip tests based on the number of test classes. You would need to determine the number of test classes in a package and update the excludes pattern manually in your `pom.xml`."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you can exclude specific tests or packages at runtime using the command line. Use the `-Dtest=!<pattern>` format to exclude tests matching a particular pattern. For example, to exclude all test classes within a specific package, you can run the following command:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtest=!your.package.name.*\n```\n\nTo exclude test classes with a specific pattern in their names, like the word \"Integration\", run:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtest=!**/*Integration*\n```\n\nKeep in mind that using this approach, you are specifying the exclusions during runtime and not making permanent changes to the `pom.xml`. It's a good option for one-time changes or when experimenting with different exclusion patterns."

      "content": "In Bash, the exclamation mark (!) has a special meaning; it is used for history expansion. To escape this special character, you must use single quotes (') around the pattern.\n\nTo exclude a package, for example, `com.cat.pscs.claims.repository`, run the following command:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtest='!com.cat.pscs.claims.repository.*'\n```\n\nTo exclude test classes with a specific pattern in their names, like the word \"Integration\", run:\n\n```\nmvn test -Dtest='!**/*Integration*'\n```\n\nThis will allow you to exclude the desired tests or packages without encountering the \"event not found\" error."
