      "content": "?\n\nThe primary causes of the obesity epidemic can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of the leading causes is the widespread availability of fast food and convenience foods. Foods that are high in fats and calories are cheap and convenient, making them an attractive option for busy individuals. Lack of exercise is another factor, as many people lead sedentary lifestyles and do not engage in enough physical activity to maintain a healthy weight. Genetics, hormonal imbalances, and certain medications can also contribute to obesity.\n\nThe main effects of the obesity epidemic are profound and far-reaching. Obesity is linked to numerous health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and chronic pain. In addition, obesity can have negative social and psychological effects, such as discrimination, low self-esteem, and depression. The economic impact of obesity is significant as well, as it leads to increased healthcare costs and decreased productivity in the workforce.\n\nOverall, the obesity epidemic is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. Efforts to promote healthy eating and physical activity, as well as policies that limit the availability and marketing of unhealthy foods, can help to reduce obesity rates and its negative effects."

      "content": "Working for a big company and a small company both have their advantages, and it depends on personal preferences and goals to determine which is better. \n\nOne of the main advantages of working for a big company is job stability. Large companies often have established reputations and financial resources that allow them to weather economic downturns and stay in business. Additionally, they may offer more opportunities for advancement and career development, with structured programs, specialized training, and mentoring programs. Working for a big company may also provide access to more resources and benefits, such as health insurance, 401(k) plans, and paid time off.\n\nOn the other hand, working for a small company can offer more flexibility and autonomy. Employees in small companies may have a wider range of responsibilities, which can allow for more creativity and decision-making opportunities. Small companies may also offer a more personalized work environment, with opportunities for direct interaction with leadership and a greater sense of camaraderie among colleagues. Additionally, small companies may be more willing to experiment with new ideas and technologies, providing opportunities to develop unique skills and gain hands-on experience in a variety of areas.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer to work for a small company. I value flexibility, creativity, and autonomy, and these are often more readily available in a small company. The personalized work environment and opportunities to interact directly with leadership also appeal to me, as I value building close relationships with colleagues and contributing directly to the business's success. While job stability and career advancement opportunities are important, I feel that the unique experiences and opportunities for growth provided by a small company outweigh those benefits."

      "content": "The rise of the \"Internet celebrity economy\" or \"Wanghong economy\" has led to a new trend of impulse spending on live-streaming. This trend can have negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. \n\nFirstly, impulse spending can lead to financial difficulties and debt. Many of the products promoted by live-streamers are not necessary or of poor quality, and consumers may end up spending money they don't have on items they don't need. This can lead to serious financial problems, including bankruptcy and default.\n\nSecondly, the Wanghong economy can also encourage unrealistic expectations and distort self-image. Many live-streamers project a false image of wealth, beauty, and success, and this can have a negative impact on viewers' self-esteem and self-worth. This can lead to a range of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and insecurity.\n\nTo address these problems, there are several solutions that can be implemented. Firstly, public education campaigns can be developed to raise awareness of the potential risks associated with the Wanghong economy. People need to be informed about the dangers of impulse spending and the importance of financial planning and responsible consumption.\n\nSecondly, regulations should be introduced to ensure that live-streamers do not exploit their audience or engage in unethical and misleading practices. This could include mandatory disclosures of sponsored content, limits on the types of products that can be promoted and clearer guidelines on the use of false advertising.\n\nThirdly, social media companies should take a more proactive role in promoting responsible consumption and healthy body image. For instance, more positive representations of diverse body types and lifestyles can be promoted, and algorithms that promote products for impulse buying can be curtailed.\n\nIn conclusion, the rapid growth of Internet celebrity economy has generated significant social, economic and psychological drawbacks, but it can be addressed through a range of measures related to education, regulation, and responsibility."

The first graph shows that the total number of students engaging in extracurricular activities increased gradually from 2016 to 2018. It registered the highest peak in 2019, with over 4500 students. On the other hand, the second graph depicts the percentage change in participation among male and female students in the same time period.

Female students are now equally represented as their male counterparts, while male participation has decreased.
