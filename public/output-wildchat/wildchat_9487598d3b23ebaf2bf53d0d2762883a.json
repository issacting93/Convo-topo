      "content": "Given the template DNA sequence 3′- ATTAGC -5', the corresponding mRNA sequence would be synthesized through transcription as follows:\n\nDNA template strand:     3′ - A     T       T       A       G       C - 5′\nmRNA transcript:          5′ - U     A       A       U       C       G - 3′\n\nThe sequence of the dipeptide formed after translation depends on the specific codons present in the mRNA. Using the genetic code, we can determine the amino acid corresponding to each codon:\n\nUAU - Tyrosine\nAUA - Isoleucine\nCGU - Arginine \n\nTherefore, the dipeptide sequence translated from this mRNA sequence would be Tyr-Ile-Arg (or YIR using the three-letter abbreviation for the amino acids)."
