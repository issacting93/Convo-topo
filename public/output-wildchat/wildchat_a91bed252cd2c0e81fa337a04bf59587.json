      "content": "Certainly! Let\u2019s create a simple Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. This program prompts the user to enter a non-negative integer and then calculates the factorial of that number. You can test this program in your Python environment.\n\n### Python Code: Factorial Calculator\n\n```python\n# Define the function to calculate factorial using recursion\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1\n    if n in (0, 1):\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Prompt the user to enter a number\n        number = int(input(\"Enter a non-negative integer to calculate its factorial: \"))\n        if number < 0:\n            print(\"Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers.\")\n        else:\n            # Call the factorial function and display the result\n            print(\"The factorial of\", number, \"is\", factorial(number))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How to Test the Program:\n\n1. **Copy** the program code.\n2. **Paste** it into a Python environment or an IDE (like PyCharm, VS Code, or an online Python compiler).\n3. **Run** the program. It will prompt you to enter a number.\n4. **Enter** a non-negative integer and press enter (*e.g., `5`*).\n5. The program will calculate and **display the factorial** of the entered number (*e.g., `The factorial of 5 is 120`*).\n\nThis simple program provides an excellent example of recursion in Python.",
