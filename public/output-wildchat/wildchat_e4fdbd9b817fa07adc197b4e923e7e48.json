Victoria laughed awkwardly and quickly made an excuse to leave. David felt humiliated and frustrated with Stella's behavior, but he couldn't seem to confront her about it.\n\nLittle did David know, Stella had been using hypnosis on him whenever he felt upset or angry, causing him to become docile and submissive.

Watch this, David.\" She snapped her fingers, and David immediately looked dazed and compliant.\n\nVictoria was taken aback by Stella's behavior. \"What's going on? Are you okay, David?\" she asked, concerned.\n\nDavid tried to speak but found that his words came out slurred. \"I'm fine, Victoria. Stella's just...good at hypnotizing people, I guess.\"\n\nBut Victoria wasn't convinced. She noticed that all the staff members seemed to be under Stella's control, and it made her uncomfortable. She said a quick goodbye to David and left, feeling uneasy about the whole situation.\n\nDavid felt embarrassed and ashamed that he couldn't stand up against Stella's power.
