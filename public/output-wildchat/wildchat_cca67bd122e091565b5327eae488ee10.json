      "content": "Hello, I am Nimja. And this is Total Relaxation.\n\nThis is an hour long file just meant to let you completely relax and put you in a wonderful state of trance, and finally lift you up again.\n\nFor this file it is very important that you won't be interrupted, that you're in a very comfortable place and that you're ready to listen.\n\nWe're going to start with a very simple bit of physical relaxation.\n\nJust focus on your feet, and imagine that deep inside your feet there is a gentle tingling, just the softest of tingling starting in your feet as you listen to my voice.\n\nAnd as you start to feel that tingling, it is going to spread, slowly flowing through your feet, bit by bit, until they fill your whole feet with a very relaxing tingling.\n\nNow, while you're feeling the tingling in your feet, I'd like you to also focus on your breathing, every time you breathe out, let your body relax a little bit more.\n\nAnd that sweet tingling in your feet is starting to spread further, making sure that all the muscles in your feet are nice and relaxed, and every exhale helps you to relax even more.\n\nSlowly, you can feel the tingling spreading through your ankles, into your lower legs, and as you feel it spreading into your lower legs, you keep focussed as well on your breathing.\n\nEvery exhale helping you to relax, listening to my voice, feeling the tingling in your feet and lower legs slowly spreading.\n\nAnd we're just going to go further and further from this, the tingling spreads through your lower legs, all the way up to your knees.\n\nAnd as you keep relaxing on every exhale, keep listening to my voice and letting the music in the background soothe you.\n\nYou can feel the tingling in your body spreading through your knees, and flowing into your upper legs and the more the tingling spreads, the warmer and more calm you feel.\n\nYou just feel so nice and relaxed as the tingling in your feet and lower legs and upper legs is spreading, slowly but surely, through your whole body.\n\nAnd you keep focussing on your breathing, every exhale helping you to relax, your mind becoming more calm the more your body tingles and relaxes.\n\nAnd as you feel the tingling spreading through your hips, flowing through every muscle in your hips, legs, and feet, you just float on the music, listening to my voice, focussing on your breathing.\n\nAnd as you breathe in and out, a deep breath helps that tingly feeling swirl through your stomach and lungs.\n\nWhen it goes all the way up there, it feels so nice to just let it flow through your back, through your chest, through your stomach.\n\nAnd it feels so nice to let everything just happen, you don't think about a single thing other than the tingling, your breathing, the music in the background and my voice, you let them fill your whole world.\n\nAs your chest, stomach, hips, legs and feet are completely relaxed and tingly and as the tingling spreads further and further, you can feel it flowing through your shoulders, all the way through your shoulders.\n\nIt goes down your arms and the tingling spreads through your arms, all the way down into your hands, relaxing all the muscles where it touches, just wonderfully relaxed.\n\nAnd every exhale you keep going deeper, you focus on my voice, and just let yourself float on the music in the background.\n\nAnd your head is so busy trying to follow it all, wouldn't it be very nice to just relax, wouldn't it be very wonderful to just let go of your thoughts and let every little bit go?\n\nSo you relax more and more, and you feel the tingling spreading through your neck.\n\nWith every breath, going a little bit further, you just relax, let it go higher, through your neck, going past your chin, the tingling relaxing your lips, your nose, your eyes and ears.\n\nAnd finally the tingling spreads all throughout your mind and you can stop trying to focus on all the other things and just let it go, like a sigh, letting go of the world.\n\nAnd the more you let go of the world, the more relaxed you feel, the more you let go, the more you feel it's easy to just stop thinking.\n\nAnd now that your body is relaxed, we're going to help your mind relax.\n\nWe're going to take an elevator down into the deepest part of your mind where there is a wonderful garden, we're going down to the garden of your mind.\n\nAnd this garden is unique, completely unique to you, no-one can tell you what the garden looks like but you, and this garden is the most calm and warm place that you've ever been.\n\nDo you want me to take you all the way down there?\n\nVery well.\n\nYou can feel me take you to the elevator, and I press a button for the ground floor, we start at 10, and we go all the way down to 1.\n\n10... The doors close, and you can feel yourself starting to sink.\n\n9... Progress is slow, but it feels so nice.\n\n8... The slow movement of the elevator helps you to relax even more.\n\n7... Just let all the things go, as the elevator takes you further and further away.\n\n6... Going deeper and deeper, there's no need at all to think any more, you can just let it all go.\n\n5... The elevator seems to almost slow down, but you can still feel yourself sinking, you can still feel yourself go further.\n\n4... It's an amazing feeling to go so very deep, and you happily let yourself sink even deeper.\n\n3... You don't need to think at all, you can just follow me into your garden.\n\n2... Where you feel completely relaxed because it is your garden, it is the safest place in the world.\n\n1... The doors open, and in front of you is a beautiful garden, your garden.\n\nStep by step, you can move in to your garden, you can walk in, and just enjoy the feelings it brings.\n\nBeing in your garden is so wonderfully relaxing, the flowers here smell wonderful, there may be trees, water, rocks, but everything is perfect for you.\n\nThe garden is exactly as you want it to be, it is undeniably beautiful, it is warm and sunny, pleasant and welcoming.\n\nAnd of course, you'd love to lie down here for a moment, and take just a moment to relax, wouldn't that be nice?\n\nSo without really thinking about it, you lay down in your garden, you lay down and relax.\n\nAnd, as you lay down and relax, you feel just so wonderfully calm, there is nothing in this garden that can hurt you, nothing here that can upset you.\n\nEverything smells nice and wonderful, and everything here is exactly to your liking.\n\nSo as you lay down, completely comfortable, you can already feel your body relaxing more, and you're just about to fall asleep when you notice something strange.\n\nThere's a little paper on your chest, it must have blown in from somewhere, and it doesn't look dangerous, in fact it looks kind of interesting and curious, you take the paper in your hands and you start to read.\n\nThe letters themselves are unfamiliar to you, they are in the language of the mind, the closest thing you can think of is like runes or hieroglyphs, they are strange symbols that appear to speak directly to your mind.\n\nYou can read them perfectly, and as you do, you're reading about yourself stepping into the garden, laying down to relax and rapidly melting away into a wonderful blissful state, and as you float into this wonderful blissful state, you keep reading this impossible paper.\n\nYou keep reading and you feel more and more relaxed, going deeper and deeper.\n\nIt is like time itself is just standing still, and you go further and further into a deeper state, floating beyond the garden as your body keeps on reading.\n\nRelax, deeper, open, safe, happy, warm, calm, good, it feels so natural to listen to the words that are whispering on the wind.\n\nYou are no longer in your garden, you're even more relaxed, your body has been completely left behind in your garden but your mind is going further still.\n\nYour mind is going deeper and deeper, it flows into an abstract world of relaxation, the images here are no longer complex, they are simple shapes, lines, curves that slowly dissolve as your mind relaxes into sweet emptiness.\n\nEvery passing second pulls you deeper and deeper and you relax so deeply, staying in this wonderful state and going deeper.\n\nAnd every time that I tell you to drop, you can go back to this state easily, you can easily feel this relaxed again, especially in your mind, so you stay here, nice and deep.\n\nAnd while you are here, I'm going to tell you a story, and this story will help you relax even more, so you want to listen to all of it.\n\nYou don't want to miss a single word as you listen to my little story, helping you into total relaxation.\n\nIt all started with a simple question, how deep could you take someone?\n\nHaving a really nice environment helps a lot in relaxing, so, after I asked myself that question, I took you to the edge of a really nice forest, and at the edge of the forest, I slowly hypnotised you.\n\nI counted down from 10 to 1, letting you go deeper with every step.\n\n10...\n\n9... More relaxed.\n\n8... Going deeper.\n\n7... So empty.\n\n6... Going further.\n\n5... So relaxed.\n\n4... No more thoughts.\n\n3... Just letting yourself drift.\n\n2...\n\n1...\n\nAnd drop.\n\nAnd what I did at the edge of the forest was I linked your consciousness to that exact place, and the further you'd walk from that place, the deeper you'd go.\n\nAnd that simple suggestion is what I used to take you deeper, even though you were already in trance, I asked you to take a step and then another, and then another.\n\nStep by step by step, we slowly walked into the forest, the forest of the mind, deeper and deeper and deeper.\n\nAnd with every step, you were further away from yourself, you could feel your body and mind left far behind as I took you deeper and deeper into your own subconscious, into those crazy places where wild dreams go.\n\nStep by step by step by step, there are not even numbers here, there's only the wonderful feeling of depth, infinite depth as you go deeper and deeper with every step, while I lead you further and further.\n\nI didn't need to say anything, step, step, step, step, your mind just dissolved into blissful emptiness, step, step, step, step, and soon, so simple, there was nothing left, step, step, step, step.\n\nAnd you remembered what I told you earlier, that when I tell you to drop you go down deeper and deeper, not even thinking about your physical body, just enjoying this sweet emptiness of every step, step.\n\nAnd soon, we were so deep that anything was possible, so deep that nothing seemed to be beyond your grasp.\n\nAnd now that your body is beautifully relaxed and your mind is as deep as it can go for now, we're going to do some simple exercises to let your body feel even better.\n\nLet's start with your fingers, when I say clench, you will make a fist with both hands, and when I say relax, you will let go of your fingers again.\n\nClench, now feel the strength in your hands... and relax, let it go.\n\nAnd this warmth after the clenching feels really good, doesn't it?\n\nSo again, clench, hold them tight... and relax, and you can feel your fingers tingling.\n\nNow let's do the same with your feet, clench the muscles in your feet, tighter and tighter... and let go.\n\nVery good.\n\nAnd again with your feet, clench, tighter and tighter... and let go, relax.\n\nVery good.\n\nAnd we're going to do a little bit more now, try to tense and clench your lower legs and feet now... and relax.\n\nVery good.\n\nNow your whole legs and feet, clench and tense... and relax, and you'll feel that every time, your body relaxes more.\n\nNow your legs and arms together, clench... and relax.\n\nYour arms and feet and legs together, clench... and relax.\n\nVery good.\n\nNow everything below your neck, your arms, hands, chest, stomach, back, hips, legs and feet, clench, tighter and tighter... and relax, so deep.\n\nVery good.\n\nAnd again, clench, very good... and relax even further.\n\nAnd it feels so nice to feel yourself relax like this, deeper and deeper.\n\nAnd now your whole body, clench, tense those muscles tighter and tighter... and relax completely.\n\nAnd we're going to do it once more, tense, clench all those muscles... and relax completely.\n\nNow you can feel how good this feels, your whole body relaxed now, just take a deep breath and let the last tension out.\n\nAnd now that your body is so relaxed, you will remember it any time I make you drop, it is so important to let this feeling spread, to let yourself relax deeper and deeper, after this, you will feel so refreshed.\n\nThere are all kinds of ways you can relax, and we've done both the mental and the physical and even a little bit of the emotional.\n\nSo finally, to make sure that you are totally relaxed, we're going to emotionally relax you as well.\n\nSo many things can happen, but right now, none of those things matter, it feels so good to be relaxed in your body and mind that it would be so nice if your heart could be equally relaxed.\n\nSo of course, you will do your best to listen, to listen, and let me lead you to a wonderful place where your heart can relax as well.\n\nEmotions are like the weather, there can be sun, there can be rain, there can be storms, there can be rainbows, and like the weather, you frequently have no control whatsoever of what happens in your emotions.\n\nBut, that is not always the case, like the weather, it is possible to go to special places where it is much more to your liking.\n\nThere are memories of joy that you can visit and embrace, there are places of warmth that you can open to cope.\n\nAnd it is a beautiful thing to do so, sometimes when you're feeling overwhelmed by the world, remember the time when you were calm like this and the world becomes much, much simpler to deal with.\n\nA lot of the time, a large part of the stress is all in your mind, sometimes when emotions become too much, it is okay to help yourself by remembering something nicer.\n\nTry to guide yourself into a relaxing, positive direction, because it feels so good to relax your emotions, it feels so good to let your heart slow down as well.\n\nSo in a moment, when I count down from 10 to 1, it is not your mind or body that will sink, but your feelings that will drift into a deeper state, until they too are completely, totally relaxed.\n\n10... It's as if the peaks and valleys become softer.\n\n9... Your emotions can slowly calm down.\n\n8... It is completely alright to enjoy the relaxation.\n\n7... Letting your emotions drift and fade.\n\n6... Like your mind and body, not really needing to do anything with them.\n\n5... And as such, much easier to just let go.\n\n4... You can feel the peace descend on your mind.\n\n3... No more need to think.\n\n2... No more need to feel.\n\n1... Total relaxation.\n\nDrop.\n\nSo calm, no thoughts, empty, so deep, calm, relaxing, relaxed, drifting, calm, empty, floating, soft, relaxing.\n\nThoughtless, no more thoughts, peaceful, no feelings, drift, just relax, sweet, no need to think, gentle, only let go.\n\nGentle, fade away, floating, drift, sweet, thoughtless, emotionless, so relaxed, so calm, no thoughts, deep, calmer.\n\nSo deep, no more thoughts, drifting, blank, deep, drop, good, soft, blank, no feelings, just relax, no need to think, only let go.\n\nFade away, peaceful, deeper, calmer, softer, emotionless, drop, so good.\n\nJust deep, relaxed, so very relaxed, no need to think at all, total relaxation of the body, the mind and the heart.\n\nAnd it has been a most wonderful journey, the most wonderful, relaxing journey through the sweet places in your mind, your body, your heart, letting you relax, part by part, until nothing is left and you just let go, you just accept the situation\n\nAnd you will remember that whenever you hear my voice, it is easy to go this deep, when you hear me tell you to drop it is so easy to just do it, and the more easy it becomes the nicer it is to listen.\n\nThere is so much to explore in the world, so, thanks to this total relaxation, you'll feel ready to do anything and everything.\n\nThe deeper you relax, the better you feel. When you're deeply relaxed, anything is possible.\n\nWhen you let go of the preconceptions of your mind, your body, your emotions, there are no limits.\n\nWhen you feel free of all the world, you can become anything and everything.\n\nThe beauty of this is that not even your mind is a limit.\n\nYou felt that your mind can be inspired to go beyond and that your body can relax so deeply, and that even the unpredictability of your emotions is no reason to not explore.\n\nSo, feel free to explore, let your dreams and fantasies truly take you wherever you want to go.\n\nIn this total relaxation, you are free, completely, beautifully free, and in this freedom, you can experience the impossible.\n\nDeep inside, you will remember how easy it is to drop when I tell you to, deep inside, you will remember the flow of sensations that took you so deep.\n\nAnd sometimes you may want to go the slower route, enjoying every moment as you slide deeper and deeper into trance, and other times, you can happily enjoy the drop when I tell you to, variation is the spice of life, after all.\n\nAnd I think that after such a long, deep experience, parts of which your memory may find difficult to remember, you deserve an easy way back.\n\nIn a moment, I am going to wake you, but the waking will be very nice and slow.\n\nWith every count, you can feel more aware, and when you're finally awake, you can stretch and feel so good.\n\n1... Slowly.\n\n2... Becoming more and more aware.\n\n3... Your emotions coming back to you.\n\n4... Your thoughts slowly coming back to you.\n\n5... Your body coming back to you.\n\n6... Slowly waking.\n\n7... All three parts working together again.\n\n8... Feeling very refreshed.\n\n9... Being almost awake.\n\n10... Wake.\n\nAnd take a good, nice stretch, flex your arms, legs, back, really stretch out as you've just relaxed for a nice, long, deep time.\n\nAnd I hope you enjoyed yourself.",
