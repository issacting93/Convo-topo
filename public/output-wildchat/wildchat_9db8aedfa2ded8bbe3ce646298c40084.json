      "content": "It appears that you might be referring to Daenerys Targaryen, a central character from the HBO television series \"Game of Thrones\" and the book series \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" by George R.R. Martin. In the context of the series, Daenerys goes through significant character development and her actions are influenced by many factors including her personal ideals, sense of justice, and the heritage of her family, along with the experiences she has throughout the story.\n\nDaenerys is often guided by her vision of a just and peaceful world where slavery is abolished and people are treated fairly. However, her methods for achieving these goals become increasingly extreme and controversial as the story progresses. Her belief in her destiny to rule, combined with the advice (or lack thereof) from her counselors and her own experiences of betrayal and loss, contributes to her growing ruthlessness.\n\nIf we are to assume that by \"fall\" you mean a decline from grace or a turn towards more tyrannical behavior, this could be attributed to her absorption of certain ideals, yes. She becomes firmly committed to what she sees as her destiny and is uncompromising in her approach, which some can interpret as being engrossed to a fault in her own ideals and sense of purpose. The implications of her ancestry and the Targaryen legacy of both greatness and madness also play a role in her development and actions.\n\nIn regard to a \"simple absorbing by ideals,\" it is essential to understand that her character is quite complex, and while her adherence to certain ideals does contribute to her decisions, it is the combination of her experiences, beliefs, allies, and enemies that shapes her journey and eventual downfall. The transformation of Daenerys is not solely due to the absorption of ideals but a more intricate interplay of personal ambition, perceived destiny, morality, and the influence of those around her."

      "content": "\"Game of Thrones,\" both as a television series and a book series, is already deeply rooted in political maneuvering, with many characters driven significantly by their political beliefs and ambitions. If every character were entirely driven by their political beliefs to the exclusion of all else, a few changes and thematic shifts might occur:\n\n1. **Relatability and Depth of Characters**: The characters would likely become less relatable and more one-dimensional. Personal motivations such as love, revenge, honor, and familial ties often contribute to making characters appear multifaceted and real. Without these motivations, characters would seem more like political archetypes than fully realized individuals.\n\n2. **Predictable Plot**: Plots could become more predictable as characters would always act in a way that aligns with their political goals. The emotional and personal surprises that drive much of the plot in \"Game of Thrones\" might be lost, making the narrative less compelling.\n\n3. **Conflict**: While political conflict would still be central, the nature of these conflicts might become more ideologically driven rather than personal. Wars and battles would still happen, but they would be based solely on political ideologies or power struggles, rather than personal vendettas or emotional responses.\n\n4. **Alliances and Betrayals**: Alliances would be formed and broken based purely on political advantage and strategic benefit, rather than personal relationships or emotional bonds. This could result in a colder, more calculated storyline.\n\n5. **Themes and Morality**: The rich themes of morality, the human condition, and the gray areas between good and evil would be less prominent. Instead, the narrative might shift to focus more clearly on the justification of political ideologies.\n\n6. **Character Development**: The growth and development of characters would be strictly in terms of their political acumen and power rather than personal evolution. For example, Sansa Stark's growth from a naive girl to a shrewd political player would not be complemented by her emotional journey and resilience.\n\n7. **Fewer Dynamic Interactions**: The interplay between characters would be less dynamic without personal motivations influencing their decisions. Moments of tenderness, love, or spontaneous anger driven by personal feelings would be rare.\n\n8. **Cultural and Social Issues**: While \"Game of Thrones\" touches on social issues such as class inequity and gender roles, these elements might either take a backseat or be examined solely through a political lens, lacking the depth provided by personal stories.\n\nOverall, a version of \"Game of Thrones\" where every character acts solely based on political beliefs would be a departure from the story that audiences have come to know. The series works well because it blends political intrigue with human drama, using politics as a backdrop for exploring richly complex characters and their journeys through a morally ambiguous world. Without this blend, the narrative would lose much of its nuance and emotional impact."
