Its head is elongated and it has a large, gaping mouth filled with razor-sharp teeth. The alien is looming over a small, frightened human who is cowering in fear. In the background, there are ruins of a destroyed city and smoke rising from the wreckage. \n\nImage inspiration: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/564154633456523589/"

      "content": "The term \"in the doghouse\" means to be in trouble or to be unfavored with someone, typically a spouse or partner. It is usually used to describe a situation when someone is in disfavor or has done something wrong and is therefore being temporarily shunned or punished by their partner or family member. The phrase originated from the earlier times when people kept their dogs in separate kennels or doghouses, outside of the family home, and when a person was in disfavor, they would be sent out to the doghouse to sleep. Thus, being \"in the doghouse\" now means being relegated to a disfavored status, as if being sent out of the house to sleep with the dogs."
