      "content": "Executive Summary:\n\nCultural Learning Experiences is a small firm that organizes educational trips for students and faculty seeking a unique learning experience abroad. The company has been using a manual system to handle all its operations, and with the recent growth in the business, it has become quite challenging for the current workforce to manage all of this manually. Therefore, the company has decided to implement a database solution to improve data storage efficiencies and customer satisfaction.\n\nAfter analyzing the candidate solutions, the recommended solution is to purchase a pre-made database solution that is customizable and can offer a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. This report provides the identification and analysis of candidate solutions and the creation of DFDs (current and proposed).\n\nIdentification and Analysis of Candidate Solutions:\n\n1. Manual System: The current manual system used by Cultural Learning Experiences involves a lot of paperwork and leads to inefficiencies, disorganization, and mistakes in recording important information regarding students, teachers, and classes. Although this is the least costly option, it is not suitable for the company's ongoing growth and scalability.\n\n2. Outsource to a Third-Party: This solution involves outsourcing the database requirements to a third-party vendor. This solution eliminates the need for the company to purchase new hardware and hire additional employees, and the vendor can handle all database operations. This solution is time-efficient and eliminates the need for ongoing maintenance and management by the company. However, it offers little customization or unique features.\n\n3. Purchase a Pre-Made Solution: This solution involves purchasing a pre-made database solution that can offer a user-friendly interface, customizable features, and enhanced reporting capabilities. This solution will eliminate the need for custom development, reduce the time to implement, and provides scalability for the company. This is a cost-effective and efficient solution for the company.\n\nRecommended Solution:\n\nThe recommended solution for Cultural Learning Experiences is to purchase a pre-made database solution that is customizable and can offer a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. This solution includes customizable features that can be tailored to the company's unique needs.\n\nThe proposed system will involve the use of a database management system and a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. This system will allow for efficient data entry, easy modification, and deletion of data, ensuring data consistency and formatting, resulting in better customer relations and employee morale.\n\nCreation of DFD's (Current and Proposed):\n\nThe current system used by Cultural Learning Experiences is a manual system that involves a lot of paperwork and inefficiencies. The current system's data flow diagram details the processes involved in the current system.\n\nThe proposed system will involve the use of a database management system and a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. The proposed system's data flow diagram reflects the new processes and data flow that will be involved in the proposed system.\n\nConclusion:\n\nCultural Learning Experiences will benefit from implementing a pre-made database solution that offers a user-friendly interface and customizable features. This solution will allow for efficient data entry, easy modification, and deletion of data. Further, data consistency and formatting will be ensured, resulting in better customer relations and employee morale. The proposed system will allow Cultural Learning Experiences to scale - accommodating their growing database requirements."

      "content": "Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am unable to draw DFD's. However, I can provide you with a written description of the current and proposed data flow diagrams.\n\nCurrent System Data Flow Diagram:\n\nThe current system used by Cultural Learning Experiences (CLE) is entirely manual. The data flow diagram of the current system includes the following processes:\n\n1. Faculty members, students, and instructors manually fill out registration forms and provide them to the office manager.\n2. The office manager stores the registration forms in a file cabinet.\n3. The office manager creates class schedules based on the registration forms received.\n4. The office manager verifies that payments have been made by checking the registration forms and informs the accounting firm of student and class information.\n5. The accounting firm produces a report based on the information provided by the office manager.\n6. The office manager provides the report produced by the accounting firm to CLE.\n7. CLE provides regular reports to the marketing firm for advertising purposes.\n\nProposed System Data Flow Diagram:\n\nThe proposed system will involve the use of a database management system and a user-friendly interface with enhanced reporting capabilities. The data flow diagram of the proposed system includes the following processes:\n\n1. Faculty members, students, and instructors electronically fill out registration forms and provide them to the office manager.\n2. The office manager enters the received data into the database.\n3. The office manager creates class schedules based on the information recorded in the database.\n4. The web system will automatically verify the payment of registration fees when students register for classes.\n5. CLE produces reports for the accounting firm and marketing firm based on the information recorded within the database.\n6. The accounting firm is notified automatically when students register for classes and pay their fees.\n7. The marketing firm can access the web system to view or download reports required to advertise CLE services.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe proposed system will allow for efficient data entry, modification, and deletion of data while ensuring consistency and formatting. The new system will reduce errors and inefficiencies, leading to better customer relations and employee morale. By implementing the proposed system, CLE will have a more scalable, cost-effective solution for its database systems."
