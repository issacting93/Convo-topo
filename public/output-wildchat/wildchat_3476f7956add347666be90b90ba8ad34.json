      "content": "Single chelation therapy, also known as intravenous chelation therapy or simply chelation therapy, is a medical treatment used to remove heavy metals and other toxins from the body. It involves the intravenous administration of a chelating agent, which is a substance that binds to heavy metals and facilitates their elimination through urine. Chelation therapy is primarily used to treat heavy metal poisoning, such as lead or mercury poisoning. However, it has also been explored as a complementary or alternative treatment for conditions like heart disease, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, despite limited scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness for these purposes. It is important to note that chelation therapy should be conducted under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional, as it can have potential side effects and risks."
