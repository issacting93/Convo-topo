Each module is directly connected to the 'Response Logic' node, reflecting how inputs are processed to generate user responses.\n\n- **User Inputs:** Clearly indicates various forms of inputs (text, images, videos, documents, audio, and text for image generation) that the system can accept from the user.\n- **Processing Modules:** Each module processes its specific type of input and then sends the processed data to the 'Response Logic' node. This linear flow facilitates a tidy arrangement suitable for concise report insertion.\n- **Response Logic:** Acts as a central hub for gathering processed information from various modules, generating appropriate responses, and determining if the response should be in text form or converted to speech.\n- **Response Handling:** The output from 'Response Logic' is either presented directly back to the user as a 'Processed Response' or converted through the 'Text-to-Speech' module into an audio output.\n\nThis layout ensures a clear, professional appearance in a report, with a justified alignment that logically depicts the flow from user input through processing to response generation. Each module’s distinct input and output are delineated, offering an accurate reflection of the FusionBot system's data flow."

It has been laid out to show all possible user inputs, ranging from text queries to image uploads, signified by dashed lines to indicate the beginning of the process.\n\n- **Processing Modules:** Each input type is processed in its specified module, transforming inputs into structured data that the Response Logic can utilize. These modules are central to the system's functionality, with direct connections to both inputs and the response logic.\n\n- **Response Logic (RL):** Serves as the core unit that integrates data from various processing modules to generate coherent responses. This component is essential for synthesizing processed input into actionable information or responses.\n\n- **Outputs:** The Response Logic can generate both text responses and audio responses (via the Text to Speech module), indicated with dashed lines leading back to the user. This showcases the system's capability to produce multiple output formats based on the input and processing results.\n\n- **Styling:** Each layer has been given a distinct color and styling to enhance readability and separation, ensuring that the diagram can be easily followed from inputs through processing to outputs.\n\nThis design aims to provide a clean, hierarchical overview of the FusionBot application's data flow, making it well-suited for inclusion in professional reports or presentations."
