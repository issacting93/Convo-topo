Your function grapher should be able to accommodate any function that can be expressed and evaluated as a mathematical function. In the case of the above example the input values of x and y are evaluated to produce a value of z producing the coordinates for a vertex. Although your program should be able to graph any function in the form z = f(x,y), you should use one of the following to submit as part of the assignment:\n\n– produces a cone shape\n– produces a hyperbolic paraboloid\n\nNOTE: that if you implement the functionality to allow the user to enter any function that they want then this is NOT required so long as your program can graph any of them.\n\nThe input values can be generated using simple for loops as indicated below or by using one of the other examples that have been identified.\n\nfor (x=Min_x; x<=Max_x; x+=.01)\n{\nfor(y=Min_y; y<=Max_y; y+= .01)\n{\nz = fun(x,y); // note that fun must evaluate the expression\nnew Vector3 ( ….);\n}\n}\n\nKeep in mind that you must capture all of the vertices that you are defining and provide them as input into one of the geometry functions within Three.js. The ParametricGeometry object is perhaps the best one to use, however, if your research identifies another approach feel free to use it so long as you can achieve the same results."

However, I can provide some guidance and suggestions to help you achieve your project goal. Here are some steps to follow:\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with Three.js library and its documentation. Three.js is a powerful tool for creating 3D graphics in web browsers using WebGL technology.\n\n2. Define your function in the form z=f(x,y). Choose a mathematical function that you want to plot, such as a cone or hyperbolic paraboloid.\n\n3. Write a JavaScript function that takes x and y as input and returns z using the mathematical formula. This function will be used to generate the values for the vertices.\n\n4. Use for loops in JavaScript to generate the input values for x and y in increments of .1 between -1 and 1.\n\n5. Evaluate the function for each x and y value to generate z values.\n\n6. Store the x, y, and z values for each vertex in an array.\n\n7. Use Three.js to create a mesh using the vertices, such as ParametricGeometry object. You can also add axis helpers and a plane to provide a point of reference for your function.\n\n8. Implement mouse controls to allow the user to rotate and scale the function using the mouse.\n\n9. Test your program and make adjustments as needed.\n\n10. Submit your project to the instructor, including the source code and a brief description of how your program works.\n\nRemember to be patient and persistent as you work through this project, and don't be afraid to ask for help if you get stuck. Good luck!"

      "content": "Bézier splines are a mathematical curve used in computer graphics and modeling. They are widely used to create smooth curves, surfaces, and shapes. The technique involves defining a series of control points that determine the path of the curve. The curve intersects each control point, but does not pass through it unless the point coincides with another control point. In this discussion, we will analyze some programs that have implemented Bézier splines, and explore how it can be used in 3D space with WebGL and Three.js API.\n\nOne example of a program that uses Bézier splines is Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator provides a range of spline tools such as the Pen tool, Anchor point tool, and Direct Selection tool that are used to create, manipulate, and manage Bézier curves. Users can define a series of control points on a curved path, and Illustrator will generate a smooth curve that passes through these points. The curve can then be manipulated using the spline tools to create complex shapes and designs.\n\nAnother example is Blender, a 3D graphics creation application. In Blender, Bézier curves are used to create complex 3D shapes and surfaces. Users can define control points that determine the path of the curve. The curve can be extruded and beveled to create solid objects, and the control points can be manipulated to add details and complexity to the object.\n\nTo implement Bézier splines in 3D space with WebGL and Three.js API, we can use a similar approach as Blender. We would define control points in 3D space that determine the path of the curve in the x, y, and z axes. We can then use Three.js to generate a curve object that passes through these control points and interpolate a smooth curve between them. Users can interact with the curve object using mouse controls to rotate and manipulate the control points to create complex 3D shapes and surfaces.\n\nIn conclusion, Bézier splines are an effective way to create smooth curves and shapes in computer graphics and modeling. Programs like Adobe Illustrator and Blender use Bézier curves to create complex designs and 3D objects. To implement Bézier splines in 3D space with WebGL and Three.js API, we can define control points in 3D space that determine the path of the curve and use Three.js to generate a curve object that passes through these points. This technique allows users to create and manipulate complex 3D shapes and surfaces with ease."

      "content": "Bézier splines are a common technique used in computer graphics to create curves and shapes. Here, we will analyze two programs that have implemented Bézier splines, and discuss how this technique can be used in 3D space with WebGL and the Three.js API.\n\nOne example of a program that uses Bézier splines is Inkscape, a vector graphics editor. Inkscape offers tools to create and manipulate Bézier curves, including the Pen tool that allows users to add and shape anchor points that define the curve. Inkscape's technique is similar to Adobe Illustrator, as users define control points (anchor points) in 2D space to create a complex curve.\n\nAnother example is Geogebra, an interactive geometry program. Geogebra also has a Bézier curve tool that allows users to define control points to shape the curve, as well as adjust the tension and continuity (i.e., smoothness) of the curve. Geogebra's approach is unique because it also allows users to define a range for the values of the control points, which can be used to create animations of the curve over time.\n\nTo implement Bézier splines in 3D space with WebGL and Three.js API, we can define control points in 3D space to create a spline curve. Since 3D space is more complex than 2D space, we will need to define additional points to control the slope of the curve. One way to do this is to define two tangent vectors at each control point, each pointing in the direction of the curve. These tangents can be adjusted to create the desired shape of the curve.\n\nWe can then use Three.js to generate a spline curve object that passes through these points and interpolate a smooth curve between them. Users can interact with the curve object using mouse controls to adjust and manipulate the control points and tangents to create complex 3D shapes and surfaces.\n\nIn conclusion, Bézier splines are a powerful technique for creating curves and shapes in computer graphics. Programs like Inkscape and Geogebra use Bézier splines to create complex 2D curves and shapes, and we can apply similar principles to create 3D curves and shapes with WebGL and Three.js API. Defining control points and tangents, and using Three.js to interpolate a smooth spline curve object allows us to create complex 3D shapes and surfaces with ease. \n\nReferences:\n\nKnuth, D. E.
