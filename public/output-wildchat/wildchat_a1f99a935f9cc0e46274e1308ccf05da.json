      "content": "Title: The Secret of 9/11: Did Israel Know Beforehand?\n\nOpening shot: Footage of the Twin Towers falling on 9/11.\n\nVoice-over: September 11, 2001, marked one of the darkest days in American history. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 innocent people and changed the world forever. But what if I told you that there is a conspiracy theory that suggests that one of America's closest allies, Israel, had prior knowledge of the attacks?\n\nCut to a group of conspiracy theorists gathered around a table.\n\nVoice-over: This group of individuals believes in the theory that Israel was involved in the 9/11 attacks and knew about it beforehand.\n\nInterview with Richard Gage, founder of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth.\n\nRichard Gage: We have evidence that the World Trade Center towers were brought down by controlled demolition. And we also know that the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, had a team in New York City on 9/11.\n\nCut to footage of five Israelis being arrested and interrogated by the FBI.\n\nVoice-over: Five Israelis were arrested and interrogated by the FBI in connection with the 9/11 attacks. They were spotted filming the Twin Towers as they collapsed, and were found to have maps of the area and box cutters in their van.\n\nInterview with Peter Lance, author of \"Triple Cross.\"\n\nPeter Lance: There are documented instances where Israeli operatives have conducted illegal surveillance activities against the United States. And the fact that these Israeli nationals were found filming the Twin Towers on 9/11 raises some serious questions.\n\nCut to footage of Mossad agents in action.\n\nVoice-over: Mossad is known for its aggressive intelligence-gathering activities worldwide, including within the United States. Some conspiracy theorists believe that Israel had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and used it to their advantage.\n\nInterview with Michael Scheuer, former CIA intelligence officer.\n\nMichael Scheuer: It's not surprising that Israel would use the 9/11 attacks to further its own agenda in the Middle East. The fact that they were in New York City on that day raises some eyebrows.\n\nCut to footage of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking to a reporter.\n\nVoice-over: Some conspiracy theorists believe that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also aware of the 9/11 attacks beforehand.\n\nInterview with Kevin Barrett, author of \"False Flag Trilogy.\"\n\nKevin Barrett: Netanyahu knew about the 9/11 attacks. In fact, he predicted them in 1995 during an interview with an Israeli newspaper. He said that the Americans would soon suffer a major terrorist attack on their soil.\n\nCut to footage of the 9/11 Commission Report.\n\nVoice-over: The 9/11 Commission Report found no evidence to suggest that Israel had any prior knowledge of the attacks.\n\nInterview with Philip Zelikow, Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission.\n\nPhilip Zelikow: We found no evidence to suggest that Israel was involved in the 9/11 attacks. The whole idea is based on circumstantial evidence and wild speculation.\n\nClosing shot: Footage of Ground Zero.\n\nVoice-over: The truth may never be known about what happened on September 11, 2001. But one thing is for sure: the world changed on that day, and we must never forget the lives lost and the impact it had on our world."
