      "content": "1. The origin of the word \"greengrocer\" comes straight from dealing with \"vegetables.\" In some places, vegetables are referred to as \"green things,\" hence the term \"green thing store\" evolved from \"青物屋\" to \"青屋:あおや\" and eventually to the current name \"やおや\" (yaoya). However, it's said that when written in kanji as \"八百屋,\" it suggests that historically, greengrocers handled a variety of goods beyond vegetables, with \"八百\" implying \"a multitude.\" This \"八百\" is used with the same meaning of \"a lot\" as in expressions like \"lying through one's teeth\" (嘘八百) or \"Edo's eight hundred and eight towns.\"\n\n2. The term \"greengrocer\" derives directly from the business of selling \"vegetables.\" Previously, even called \"青物,\" or \"green items,\" it led to the transition from \"青物屋\" to \"青屋\" (green store), and finally to the name \"やおや\" (yaoya). However, it's believed that the kanji \"八百屋\" was chosen because these stores used to sell many items, with \"八百\" representing \"a great many.\" This kanji is also used to convey \"a multitude\" in phrases like \"嘘八百\" (a pack of lies) or \"Edo's 八百八町\" (many streets of Edo).\n\n3. The word \"greengrocer\" traces its roots to the sale of \"vegetables,\" with vegetables once called \"青物\" or \"greens,\" leading to the shops being called \"青物屋\" and subsequently \"青屋\" (green shop), which has become the modern term \"やおや\" (yaoya). Yet, the kanji \"八百屋\" is used possibly because these vendors offered a multitude of items, not just vegetables, with \"八百\" implying \"numerousness,\" a concept also seen in phrases like \"嘘八百\" (numerous lies) or \"江戸八百八町\" (many neighborhoods of Edo).\n\n4. The name \"greengrocer\" essentially comes from the handling of \"vegetables.\" Vegetables were once called \"青物,\" leading to the term \"青物屋,\" then \"青屋\" (ao-ya), and eventually the present-day \"やおや\" (yaoya). The kanji \"八百屋\" might represent the varied merchandise these stores used to sell, with \"八百\" signifying \"many,\" which is similarly employed in terms like \"嘘八百\" (countless lies) or \"江戸八百八町\" (Edo's many districts).\n\n5. Greengrocers are named from their primary trade of \"vegetables.\" From calling vegetables \"青物,\" or \"green things,\" shops became known as \"青物屋\" to \"青屋\" (ao-ya), evolving into the modern \"やおや\" (yaoya). When written in kanji as \"八百屋,\" it is thought to incorporate \"八百,\" meaning \"abundant,\" because these shops used to offer a variety of products. The term \"八百\" is used similarly in other expressions denoting \"plenty,\" such as \"嘘八百\" (a great many lies) or \"江戸八百八町\" (the many quarters of Edo)."
