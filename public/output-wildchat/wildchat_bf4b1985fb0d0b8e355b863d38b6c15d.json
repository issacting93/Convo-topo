      "content": "Ethical Considerations\n\nThe interplay between video games and human psychology encompasses several ethical considerations crucial to our investigation. First, respecting participant privacy and confidentiality is paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive psychological outcomes. Data collected for this study, particularly concerning individual motivations, effects on mental health, and therapeutic potentials, will be anonymized to protect identities. Furthermore, the issue of informed consent is critical; all participants must be fully aware of the study's scope, including potential risks and benefits, and their consent must be explicitly obtained and documented.\n\nAnother key ethical concern relates to the psychological wellbeing of participants. Engaging with video games, especially those designed to manipulate emotions or induce stress for therapeutic purposes, could potentially harm individuals. We commit to closely monitoring participants' psychological states and providing support mechanisms for those adversely affected.\n\nMoreover, the depiction and inclusion of certain video games may involve sensitive content, raising concerns over exposure to violence or triggering themes. We will carefully select games to minimize harm, ensuring they are culturally and developmentally appropriate for our participant group.\n\nFinally, there's an ethical obligation to critically examine and report any biases or limitations in our study. It involves acknowledging the complex nature of psychological responses to video games and avoiding overgeneralization of findings. Through a thorough ethical review and adherence to ethical guidelines, this study aims to contribute responsibly and meaningfully to the understanding of video games' psychological impacts."

      "content": "A system can be defined as an arrangement consisting of physical components that\nare connected or related in such a way that they act as an entire unit (DiStefano et al\n2011). Kump et al (2011) defines a system as an entity that is composed of diverse\nparts (components) that are inter-related. Together they function as a complex\nwhole. A system may also exhibit adaptive, dynamic and evolutionary behaviour\n(Meadows, 2008). DiStefano et al (2011) go on to define a control system as being\nan arrangement of physical components that are connected in such a manner as to\nregulate itself or another system. Given this definition, it could be argued that the\nphysical environment is abound with control systems.\nA systems approach can be applied in virtually any area of inquiry (Kump et al 2011).\nBy studying the environment in systems terms and gaining an insight into its\nbehaviour at a particular moment in time, it might be possible to build a more\naccurate picture of both the past behaviour of a physical system, whilst making more\naccurate predictions about the future. This can be especially important, for example,\nwhen considering the extent to which anthropogenic activity is responsible for\nmodifications of the environment and the consequences of such change.\nComponents of a system inter-relate in such a way as to determine the state of the\nsystem by allowing for the flow of information from one component to the next via\nlinks known as couplings. (Kump et al, 2011) Both positive and negative couplings\ncan exist. In the case of a positive coupling, a change in one component, leads to a\nchange in the same direction in the connected component, e.g. an increase in\ninsolation could directly result in an increase in the Earth’s surface temperature.\nConversely, in a negative coupling, a change in one component would result in a\nchange in the opposite direction in the connected component, e.g. an increase in\nsurface albedo would directly result in a reduction of the Earth’s surface temperature\n(Kump et al 2011).\nS810 MSc Project: H2O and CO2 as a forcing mechanism on the Noachian Climate System\n18\nFigure 3.1.1. An example of a negative coupling (A), where an increase in albedo\nresults in a reduction in surface temperature and a positive coupling (B), where an\nincrease in insolation results in an increase in surface temperature.\nCouplings may also result in a feedback loop, which is defined by Kump et al (2011\np.22) as a “self perpetuating mechanism of change and response to that change”.\nFeedback loops may also be negative or positive, where negative loops reduce the\neffects of the disturbance and where positive loops amplify the effects. Figure 3.1.2\nshows an example of a positive feedback loop where an increase in albedo results in\na reduction in surface temperature. In turn, this increases ice-cover, which also has\nthe effect of increasing the albedo.\nFigure 3.1.2. An example of a positive feedback loop, where an increase in albedo\nresults in a reduction in surface temperature, allowing ice cover to increase which, in\nturn, further increases albedo.\nA system is described as being in a state of equilibrium when it does not change until\nsomething creates a disturbance. Equilibrium may be either stable or unstable. In a\nstable state of equilibrium, a small disturbance to the system will result in responses\n(A)\n(B)\nS810 MSc Project: H2O and CO2 as a forcing mechanism on the Noachian Climate System\n19\nthat will quickly return the system to a state of equilibrium. In a system in an\nunstable state of equilibrium, however, a small disturbance may result in system\nadjustments that carry the system further and further from its original state until a\nnew state of equilibrium, if such a state exists.\nLooking, then, in a system with a single feedback loop, a negative loop demonstrates\na state of stable equilibrium whilst a positive feedback loop demonstrates a state of\nunstable equilibrium. In the case of environmental and natural systems, such as the\nMars climate system, however, the reality is considerably more complex. Systems\nsuch as these are typically made up of a combination of several subsystems that\nmay consist of both positive and negative feedback loops (Meadows, 2008).\nA perturbation of a system is a temporary disturbance of a system, whereas a forcing\nmechanism is a more persistent disturbance. Kump et al (2011) gives as an\nexample of a perturbation, the volcanic outgassing of sulphur dioxide into the\natmosphere during a terrestrial (Earth) eruption. As the SO2 reacts to form sulphate\naerosols in the atmosphere in the weeks following the eruption, it prevents a small\namount of insolation reaching the Earth’s surface, lowering average global\ntemperatures. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June1991 (Watanabe et al, 2004)\nwas an example of this, where temperatures a lowering of average global\ntemperatures by 0.3-0.5 °C for 2-4 years (Robock et al, 1991) was attributed to the\neruption. Over the course of some years (some Pinatubo aerosols were found to\ndecay as recently as the late 1990s (Watanabe et al, 2004)), however, temperatures\nreturned to previous levels as the sulphur was naturally removed from the\natmosphere. As Kump et al (2011) states, it is difficult, however, to definitively\nattribute such variation to the eruption alone, as the climate is naturally variable.\nForcing mechanisms, on the other hand, such as increasing levels of sunlight\nreceived by the Earth over billions of years, are more persistent in nature. This\nproject focuses on volcanic outgassing of carbon dioxide and water as a forcing\nmechanism on the Mars climate system during the Noachian because volcanism is\nconsidered in a more sustained fashion, rather than an isolated eruption, which, in\nitself, may have a very temporary effect on the Martian climate, in terms of geological\ntimescales. For the purposes of this project, a period of extensive and repeated\nvolcanism is considered as the principal forcing mechanism responsible for shifting\nS810 MSc Project: H2O and CO2 as a forcing mechanism on the Noachian Climate System\n20\nthe climate system into a state of equilibrium capable of supporting liquid water at\nthe surface.\nhow many words is this"
