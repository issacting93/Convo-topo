Claire, please explain the business scenario in which two different items are returned on two different dates. In this scenario, there will be a different return event that does not have a return order number, such as a direct walk-in that is not initiated through the web. As a result, there will be multiple records against the order number, carrier code, and status code. Which record should be considered out of the two?"
