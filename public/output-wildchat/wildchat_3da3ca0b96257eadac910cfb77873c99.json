SMART Objective: By the end of the year, implement NFT blockchain technology to authenticate the ownership of at least 500 specific celebrity-worn products, each accompanied by a signed NFT from the respective celebrity.\n\n2. SMART Objective: Establish partnerships with at least three major production houses within the next six months to obtain authentication letters for every product offered, enhancing credibility and trust in the authenticity of our offerings.\n\n3. SMART Objective: Arrange collaborations with cinema houses in at least five major cities within the next year, securing physical booths in front of movie gates to showcase our products. This will increase brand credibility and exposure, leading to a 30% increase in sales within the first six months of deployment."

However, based on the topic and title of the article, some potential hypotheses related to green marketing strategies and consumer perceptions in addressing greenwashing could include:\n\n1. Hypothesis 1: Consumers' perception of a company's green marketing claims positively influences their perception of the company's environmental sustainability efforts.\n\n2. Hypothesis 2: Greenwashing negatively affects consumers' trust in a company's environmental claims.\n\n3. Hypothesis 3: Consumers' awareness and knowledge of greenwashing tactics positively influences their skepticism towards companies' environmental claims.\n\n4. Hypothesis 4: Consumers' trust in third-party certifications positively influences their perception of a company's green marketing claims.\n\nPlease note that these hypotheses are hypothetical and may not align with the actual hypotheses presented in the Rahman and Nguyen‐Viet (2023) study."

      "content": "In their study on green marketing strategies and consumer perceptions in addressing greenwashing, Rahman and Nguyen-Viet (2023) investigate several hypotheses related to these topics. One hypothesis suggests that consumers' perception of a company's green marketing claims has a positive impact on their perception of the company's environmental sustainability efforts. This hypothesis implies that consumers are more likely to view companies as environmentally responsible if they perceive their green marketing claims to be true and genuine. Another hypothesis proposed in the study is that greenwashing negatively affects consumers' trust in a company's environmental claims. This hypothesis suggests that when consumers perceive greenwashing - the practice of making false or exaggerated environmental claims - their trust in the company diminishes. Additionally, the researchers hypothesize that consumers' awareness and knowledge of greenwashing tactics positively influence their skepticism towards companies' environmental claims. This hypothesis implies that the more knowledgeable and aware consumers are of greenwashing strategies, the more likely they are to approach companies' environmental claims with skepticism. Lastly, another hypothesis posits that consumers' trust in third-party certifications positively influences their perception of a company's green marketing claims. This hypothesis implies that third-party certifications can enhance consumers' trust in a company's environmental claims, as they are viewed as unbiased and credible sources of validation. These hypotheses collectively contribute to understanding the complex interplay between green marketing strategies, consumer perceptions, and the issue of greenwashing."
