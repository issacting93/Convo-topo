In this case, C is trying to establish a sense of trust and familiarity with D in order to manipulate him into lending her money. By not using polite language or mitigating her request, C is acting as if she has a close and equal relationship with D, which further reinforces the idea that she is an old friend in need."

      "content": "在这种情况下，骗子C假扮成朋友/亲属，假装是D的久违的老朋友。她使用粤语口音和亲密的语气与目标交谈。由于粤语口音在中国南部大部分地区的方言中都能听到，C的使用使D难以确定C的确切位置。因此，D被迫扩展记忆以符合C作为“老朋友”的身份。在这种情况下，C使用的粤语方言口音有助于获得D的信任，因为人们都会期望“老朋友”会使用自己的口音说话。熟悉的方言和亲密的称呼“老同学”也拉近了他们之间的距离。此外，人们通常会在电话中使用自己的名字进行自我识别。然而，在这种情况下，骗子通过提问“猜猜我是谁？”来回避提供姓名。由于她作为女性的个人身份，这样一个少女般的问题不太可能引起怀疑。此外，她责备D不记得她的声音，试图让他感到内疚，从而停止怀疑她的动机。最后，C借钱的借口并不是为了自己的利益，而是为了帮助一个朋友，给人一种珍惜友谊的形象，同时让D别无选择只能答应她的请求。值得注意的是，骗子通过声称在厦门这个离D所在地上海很远的地方避免了面对面的会面。最后，她通过承诺重逢并归还她所“借”的钱来加强老朋友身份的建构。\n\n在礼貌方面，C比案例（1）中的A更不恭顺。她没有尝试缓解请求带来的面子上的威胁。相反，她直接陈述她想从对方借大笔钱：“想向你借...”。根据布朗和莱文森（1987）的观点，这样直接的言辞行为通常用于彼此关系密切、在权力上平等的人之间。"

      "content": "translate the following paragraphs into Chinese.  5.2.3 The identity ‘business clerk’\nThe identity business clerk refers to workers in a commercial institution, such \nas a department store or a power supplier. Con artists using this situational type \nconstructing false identities for fraudulent purposes 111\nusually defraud people by pretending that they provide services, as exemplified \nin Case (3).\nCase (3) Context: A middle-aged-sounding man E calls Mr F on the telephone . Unlike the previous cases, the con artist E directly declares himself as an official \nclerk at Telecom. To help strengthen the impression of his identity construction, \nhe uses standard Mandarin, polite language such as nin hao 您好 ‘hello’ and the \nhonorific nin 您 ‘you’ and technical jargons such as touzhi 透支 ‘deficit’ and tingji\n停机 ‘disconnect’. Moreover, ‘1680 yuan’, a plausible amount of money for the kind \nof ‘deficit’ he claims to have been incurred, shows his knowledge of relevant infor\u0002mation, further improving his credibility. (A rounded up number such as 2000 \nyuan would sound much less convincing.) Nevertheless, E’s following discourse \ncontradicts his fabricated identity. For instance, the serious tone, the switch from \nhonorific nin 您 ‘you’ to regular ‘you’ (ni 你) and the shift from informing to the \nwarning of ‘your bank account is controlled by a gang of criminals for money \nlaundering, drug deals, and gun smuggling’ and the imperative ‘transfer all your \nmoney into a safe account’ sounds more characteristic of a police officer than \na Telecom clerk. In reality, Telecom has no access to such information, and its \nservices include neither ‘arresting gangs’ nor ‘protecting assets’. Given a recipro\u0002cal relationship between identity and discursive practices (Chen, 2018, p. 39), it \nseems that the mismatch between identity and discourse compromises E’s inten\u0002tion to intimidate F and contaminates F’s fabrication as a Telecom clerk. As a \nmatter of fact, many targets discovered this mismatch at this point.2\n Apparently, \nwhether the discursive contents match the assumed identity is an effective cue for \ndetecting deception."

      "content": "5.2.3 “业务员”身份\n“业务员”身份指的是商业机构中的工作人员，比如百货商店或电力供应商。利用这种情境类型来构造虚假身份进行欺诈的骗子通常通过假装提供服务来欺骗人们，就像案例（3）中所示。\n\n案例（3）背景：一个听起来中年的男人E打电话给F先生。与之前的案例不同，骗子E直接声称自己是电信公司的官方职员。为了加强对其身份构建的印象，他使用标准的普通话，礼貌的用语，如“您好”和敬语“您”，以及透支、停机等技术术语。此外，“1680元”，对于他声称已经发生的“透支”而言是一个合理的金额，显示了他对相关信息的了解，进一步提高了他的可信度。（2000元这样四舍五入的数字会听起来不那么令人信服。）然而，E接下来的言辞与他所编造的身份相矛盾。例如，严肃的语气，从敬语“您”到常规的“你”，从通知变成“你的银行账户受到一个犯罪团伙控制，用于洗钱、毒品交易和走私枪支”的警告，以及“将你的所有钱转到一个安全账户”的命令，更符合警察而不是电信职员的特征。事实上，电信公司并没有访问这样的信息的权限，其业务既不包括“捕捉犯罪团伙”也不包括“保护资产”。鉴于身份与话语实践之间存在相互关系（陈，2018，第39页），似乎身份与话语不匹配削弱了E威胁F并感染F作为电信职员的虚构意图。实际上，许多受害者在这一点上发现了这种不匹配。显然，话语内容是否与假定的身份相符是检测欺诈的一个有效线索。\n\nNote: Please be aware that the translation provided here is for reference only and may require further review and revision."
