This leak occurs when the engine is shut down or when the engine starts, causing some disturbance for our pilots. However, it is my understanding that there is an ATR service letter that provides tolerance for such leaks; they are only prohibited when the engine is in operation. Could you please provide us with the latest revision of this service letter?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to bring your attention to an investigation that took place a few years ago on this same issue. A team from PWC visited our site at that time. Would it be possible to discuss this matter with them?\n\nLastly, I wanted to provide you with some information regarding the AOG situation. [Please add any relevant details here].\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards, [Your Name]"
