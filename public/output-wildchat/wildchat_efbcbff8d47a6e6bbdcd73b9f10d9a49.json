You may need to use a different data type such as a string or a custom data type to store a date range like 2001-2002. \n\nOne way to store a date range like 2001-2002 could be to use two date columns, one for the starting date and the other for the ending date. For example, you could use a schema like:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  start_date DATE,\n  end_date DATE\n);\n```\n\nAnd then store the values like:\n\n```\nINSERT INTO my_table (id, start_date, end_date) VALUES (1, '2001-01-01', '2002-12-31');\n```\n\nThis way, you can retrieve the date range using a query like:\n\n```\nSELECT CONCAT(start_date, ' - ', end_date) AS date_range FROM my_table WHERE id = 1;\n``` \n\nWhich would return:\n\n```\n| date_range          |\n|---------------------|\n| 2001-01-01 - 2002-12-31 |\n```",

      "content": "No, Primary keys cannot be null. A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must have a unique value for each row and cannot be null.\n\nThe main difference between a primary key and a unique constraint is that a primary key is a combination of a unique constraint and a not-null constraint. In other words, a primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table and cannot contain null values, while a unique constraint only requires that the values in the column(s) be unique but does not necessarily prevent null values.\n\nHere are a few other differences between primary keys and unique constraints:\n\n- A table can have only one primary key, but it can have multiple unique constraints.\n- Foreign keys reference a primary key, not a unique constraint.\n- Primary key columns are typically used as the basis for clustering indexes, while unique constraints are not.\n\nIn summary, both primary keys and unique constraints ensure that each row in a table has a unique value for a given column or combination of columns, but primary keys have additional constraints regarding null values and are used as a reference for foreign keys and clustering indexes.",

      "content": "Yes, specifying the number of digits for floating-point data types is deprecated in some databases and will be removed in a future release.\n\nThe reason behind this is that floating-point precision errors can occur when working with floating-point data types, especially when performing arithmetic operations with them. This is because floating-point numbers are stored as approximations in binary notation, and not all numbers can be represented exactly.\n\nTo avoid precision errors, databases now recommend using the appropriate floating-point data type without specifying the number of digits. For example, in MySQL, instead of using FLOAT(10,2), it is recommended to use FLOAT or DOUBLE, depending on the required precision.\n\nWhen using floating-point data types, it is important to be aware of the potential for precision errors and how to best handle them. This may involve rounding or truncating the values as needed or using a decimal data type instead.",

      "content": "If you receive a warning that specifying the number of digits for floating-point data types is deprecated and will be removed in a future release, you can fix it depending on the database management system you are using.\n\nFor example, in MySQL, instead of using FLOAT(3, 2), which specifies a floating-point number with a precision of 3 digits and a scale of 2 digits, you can use the FLOAT data type without specifying the precision and scale.\n\nHere are some examples of how to define floating-point variables without specifying the number of digits in different database management systems:\n\nMySQL:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\n  id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n  price FLOAT\n);\n```\n\nPostgreSQL:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n  price FLOAT\n);\n```\n\nOracle:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\n  id NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,\n  price FLOAT\n);\n```\n\nIt is important to note that some database management systems may not support the specification of precision and scale for floating-point data types, and others may have different syntax for defining them. It is always recommended to check the documentation of your database management system for the recommended syntax for defining floating-point data types.",

The fetchall() method is called on the cursor object to retrieve all the records, which are then stored in the \"results\" variable as a list of tuples.\n\nFinally, a loop is used to iterate through the \"results\" list and print each record. The database connection is then closed using the close() method of the database object.",
