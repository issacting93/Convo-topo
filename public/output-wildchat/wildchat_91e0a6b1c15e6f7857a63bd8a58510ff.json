      "content": "Alternate version 2\n\nA Doctor Who fanfiction, Basically a retold version of \"Human Nature/The Family Of Blood\", Also a crossover with KikoRiki\n\nName of this story: Doctor Who: Human Nature (feat. KikoRiki) \n\nMain characters: The 10th Doctor, Martha Jones\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a ram named Wally, who was adventuring through a rumoured haunted house near Cambridgeshire \n\nWally figured that there was no such thing as ghosts, and so was content to push through the haunted house.  A man shot him in the side. He screamed in agony and ran away, leaving a trail of blood and screams behind him. He eventually fainted. The man dissapeared, he was part of a crime family known as the Family of Blood\n\nThe Family of Blood were after the Doctor's essence to stay alive\n\nMeanwhile,\n\n\"Martha, you trust me don't you\" \"This watch is me\" \"I'm gonna become human\" were words uttered by the elusive Time Lord, the Doctor, who was about to use the Chameleon Arch to rewrite his biology, changing a Time Lord into a human.\n\nHis faithful companion , Martha Jones, could not believe her eyes as the Doctor screamed in pain as he became human, He became a human named John Smith. The TARDIS landed in a cottage near St. Albans, Hertfordshire ,where Smith was going on a excursion to a haunted house.\n\nJohn Smith spoke to Joan, a maid that \"I've been having these weird dreams, I have 2 hearts and I am a Time Lord. They say that I'm a man known as the Doctor\" Joan uses a stethoscope and confirms \"You only have one heart and one soul\".\n\nJohn Smith kept his dreams in a journal called \"The Journal of Impossible Things\" Here he writes his past incarnations, the Daleks, the Cybermen and the Tardis.\n\nThe excursion began, When they got there John Smith was talking to Joan about his dreams, Meanwhile, Martha spotted a trail of blood, when she followed it, what she saw was disheartening,  apuddle of blood spreading in stripes across the stone floor in different directions. Martha walked forward to understand what was happening. In the very center of this puddle lay Wally. True, Martha did not know what kind of purple fluffy round thing with twisted horns and small hooves was, but realizing that it was from this body that blood was flowing, She sent John and Joan to see it. And of course they soon came running. But the picture they saw scared them.\n\n\"What happened, Martha?\" - John Smith stopped and exclaimed at the same time, looking intently at what was lying on the floor.\n\n“There’s some kind of furball lying around in the blood, we should help him,” Martha muttered.\n\nBarash's body was picked up by levitation and carried somewhere, and Harry went to his room - to sleep.\n\nAll the KikoRiki sat down near Wally's bed.\nDokko the Moose, Chiko the Hedgehog and Rosa the Pig were sobbing. Barry the Bwar snorted loudly, blowing his nose into his handkerchief, as a nurse approached them.\n\n“I don’t know how to treat him,” the woman muttered sadly.\n\n- He will die? - Rosa screamed, throwing her eyes up.\n\n— Yes.\n\nRosa began to cry harder, almost sobbing, but she tried to calm down.\n\n- Inhale-exhale-inhale-exhale-inhale - Rosa died on from her last exhale, she died from shock.\n\nSuddenly John Smith entered the room.\n\n- Since they died, they must be buried. Joan!\n\n- Yes,\n\n- Order a coffin, we will have a funeral.\n\n\"It will be done, Mr. Smith.\"\n\nThe rest of the KikoRiki dispersed, waiting for the funeral to begin...\n\nThe funeral was quiet and took place in secret. Rosa and Wally were buried in a common coffin.\n\nOlga the Owl wiped her tears with a handkerchief. Barry hugged her. Everyone was sad.\n\nThey had just lost 2 of their best friends.\n\nOh, you could see that Rosa was crying just before she died... she really loved Wally very much...\n\nLater that night, the KikoRiki chose to stay at the cemetary, waiting until it was time to leave,\n\nMeanwhile, Martha went to the TARDIS as John had fallen in love with Joan, She played a video where the Doctor says \"Here's a list of instructions for when I'm human, Number 1 if they find us, you know what to do, Open the watch, I've put a perception filter on it so the human me won't think anything of it, to him it's just a fob watch, so he won't understand its significance, Open the watch and all the time lord essence will come out, But dont open it unless you have to, because then the Family of Blood will be able to find me. Number 2, don't let me abandon you, Number 3\" Martha skipped through the video trying to find out what to do if the Doctor falls in love with a human, there was nothing\" \n\nBack at the cottage, everyone was singing a memorial hymn for Wally and Rosa.\n\n- We're gonna miss you, friends... \n\nThey were talking about their favourite memories with them, John Smith was talking to Joan \"It's amazing how these colorful animals act like humans, It's almost as if they are magical\", Joan then said \"John Smith, I love you\", They hugged, much to Martha's dismay, because now John would never want to go back to being the Doctor..., The music began to play \"Fairytale of New York\", as they began thinking about Christmas and how they would have loved to spend it with Wally and Rosa.\n\nA blue rabbit, Krash found the fob watch, He briefly opened it and saw flashes of the life of The Doctor, He saw the 9th doctor running to save Rose from the Annedroid,  the 10th doctor losing Rose to the alternate universe, the 1st doctor meeting the Daleks, even 7th regenerating into 8th, He quickly closed it with his left paw, This alerted the Family, and they appeared, Son of Mine, Mother of Mine, Father of Mine and Daughter of Mine, they had came to hunt him down...\n\nMeanwhile, everyone else was crying in their hotel rooms, Krash went to see Olga who was crying at a photo of Rosa, She showed him the photo, and he showed Olga the watch, Meanwhile, the Family had begun a attack and they grabbed Martha and Joan. They began saying \"Change Back, You've turned human\" John Smith said \"I was born human like the rest of you\", Then a gun was pointed at Joan and Martha \"Which is going to die, Your friend?or your lover, Your choice\". Just then, they were grabbed and saved by a blue paw, it was Krash, who ran them to safety and said \"Those things, they want you, They say you're a hero, I gotta go see Chiko\" He runs away, Meanwhile, they see the Tardis, John Smith says \"I've never seen that before in my life\"\n\nLater, a person was going to the library with the invisibility cloak, He saw Chiko crying, He was still mourning the deaths of Wally and Rosa, and Chiko didn't understand why they had to go to the funeral...\n\nBarry was going to the Herbology block, to study more.\n\nOlga said that untill further notice, the KikoRiki will not be returning to their valley but will temporarily stay at the cottage, I continued to find evidence about the prophecy, when I heard strange noises\n\nI left the library. The invisibility cloak I begged for important matters really helped me stay there until very late. To my surprise, I did not see the, the others walking at night. I walked along the corridors, where there was complete silence, and went out into the street.\n\nInhaling the wet night air from the recent rain and enjoying the silence, I, I don’t know how, wandered into the cemetery.\n\nSuddenly I heard a creak, which seemed very loud in the silence. Walking forward, I saw a magician sitting near a hole that he seemed to have dug himself. He pulled out the coffin from there and took off the lid. Grinning strangely, a magician took Rosa and Wally out of the coffin, which Harry told me about. The old man put the pig in a sack and threw it over his shoulder, and he pressed the ram to his body and adjusted his cloak so that Wally was not visible from under his clothes.\n\nHaving buried the empty coffin again, Fthe magician went back to the building l. I barely managed to hide behind one of the tombstones. And when he left, I rushed towards the cottage to tell someone about what I had seen.\n\nI took off the cloak revealing myself as Krash, I ran back and saw people were getting shot by the Family, I had the watch, I had to give it to John so he could become the Doctor and save us all.  I ran as fast as I could but I tripped and fell into a gooey, bubbling cauldron, I was being sucked underneath it, I struggled to free myself, As I sank I let out gurgled screams for help, Eventually my feet sank under and I had submerged completely, I still hope someone can save me before it's too late\n\nMeanwhile the Family had formed an army, and Martha had found the watch falling down the stairs after Krash the Rabbit had fell into the cauldron, She grabbed it and went to John Smith, begging him to become the Doctor \"We need the Doctor, People are dying\" He said \"I'm John Smith, That's all I wanna be, just John Smith, Isn't he a good man\" And she said \"Yes, Yes, but we need the Doctor\"\n\nJoan was also convincing the Doctor to return, Meanwhile, the Magician was taking the corpses of Wally and Rosa, and planning to use his magic on them, The Doctor put his hand on the watch and has a vision of what his life with Joan could be like, getting married, having children, growing old together. He isn't ready to give this up, But when the Magician blasts his magic. a miracle happens, but will they be enough to convince the Doctor to return?\n\nAs the chaos spread through the cottage, the KikoRiki faced the unthinkable. Two of their own were stolen by a shadowy figure, a magician whose intention remained cloaked in mystery.\n\nJohn Smith stood, tormented, the fob watch’s weight heavy in his hands. Joan and Martha pleaded, their eyes reflecting the urgency of the moment. Lives hung in the balance, and the Doctor’s return was their only salvation.\n\nMeanwhile, the magician had reached a secluded section of the woods, far from prying eyes. In a ritual of arcane energy and whispered incantations, he chanted over the bodies of Wally and Rosa. The spells he weaved teetered on the edge of light and dark, poised to enact either resurrection or desecration.\n\nAt the cottage, under relentless assault by the Family of Blood’s forces, Krash’s desperate plea echoed within John Smith’s soul. A transformation beckoned, the Doctor’s essence ready to ignite, but love’s anchor held firm.\n\nThe air crackled with magic as light enveloped the magician’s form. The impossible unfolded before vacant eyes; Wally stirred, a sharp breath breaking the silence of death, followed by Rosa. Their awakening was gentle, like that of sleepers from a tranquil dream, untarnished by the horrors of their end. The magician gasped, his power waning but proving enough. With his task complete, he vanished just as swiftly as he had appeared.\n\nBack at the besieged cottage, the weight of countless lives bore down upon John Smith. Tears blurred his vision, a storm of emotions threatening to unravel him. Joan’s gentle touch steered his heart, while Martha’s fierce determination steadfastly guided his resolve.\n\nThe ticking watch in his grip commanded attention, the incessant rhythm akin to the dual heartbeats of his true self. With a trembling hand, he surrendered to the cascade of images, the cacophony of cries and the surge of memories.\n\nThe latch clicked open; a brilliant light issued forth from the age-old timepiece. Gallifreyan energies swirled, obliterating the boundaries of John Smith’s existence. The Doctor was returning.\n\nA sound like the birth of stars filled the room, and the visage of the Time Lord coalesced. He stood tall, his gaze piercing the veil of ordinary perception. With newfound clarity, he spoke, his voice carrying the weight of eternity.\n\n“Joan, Martha, I’ve returned. It’s time to end this.”\n\nWith the Doctor once again in command of his boundless faculties, the showdown with the Family of Blood was inevitable. Strategy and intuition wound together, forming a plan that employed cunning over brute force.\n\nAs the Family of Blood raged on, the newly reconstituted Doctor initiated his masterstroke. With Martha and Joan by his side, he exploited the Family’s singular weakness—temporal awareness. Time itself became a weapon as the Doctor ensnared the Family in temporal loops, elongated seconds became lifetimes, and in these spiraling eons, the essence the Family sought became poison to them.\n\nOne by one, each member of the Family found their immortality a curse rather than a blessing. Father of Mine was imprisoned in unbreakable chains, Daughter of Mine trapped in the mirrors of the world, forever to glance and never touch. Mother of Mine was cast into the heart of a collapsing star, forced to witness the birth and death of galaxies, while Son of Mine’s essence was embedded in the form of a scarecrow, forever watching over fields with hollow eyes.\n\nThe Family, now defeated, ceased to plague the Earth. The Doctor’s clever maneuver saved the day, and the celebration was palpable among the survivors who watched the morning sunlight dispel the remnants of an otherworldly nightmare.\n\nHowever, amidst the joy, a shadow fell across the KikoRiki and Martha Jones’ hearts. Though Wally and Rosa had miraculously returned, one precious life remained unaccounted for.\n\n“Where’s Krash?” Martha’s voice cracked the hopeful veneer.\n\nEveryone halted, searching their memories for the last vision of their friend. Suddenly, the glee turned to dread as they realized Krash was nowhere to be seen.\n\n“He must’ve been… taken in the chaos,” Joan whispered, her hand over her heart.\n\nMartha’s eyes glistened, her thoughts racing to the blue rabbit who had risked so much. The Doctor placed a consoling hand on her shoulder, sorrow lining his ageless face.\n\n“Sometimes, in the vastness of time and space, some heroes remain unsung, their deeds echoing in silence. But their spirits, Martha, they persist. Within each of us, in every choice for the good we make, remember that,” the Doctor said solemnly.\n\nWith a heavy heart, they paid their respects to the unseen sacrifice. The Doctor and Martha then wandered back to the TARDIS, beset with a silence that spoke volumes.\n\nMeanwhile, they pulled his body out of the cauldron, Krash's body was lifeless, They tried giving him CPR, but to no avail.\n\nWally and Rosa looked upon his lifeless form with horror.\n\n“He can’t be dead… No, this can’t be happening, He risked his life for us, He helped John Smith become the Doctor again, He can't be gone, This isn’t true, It’s not true.”\n\nRosa slowly began to cry, and Wally, whose grief threatened to overtake him, tried comforting her.\n\n“It’s okay, Rosa, He's in a better place., We will hold a memorial for him\" The one most affected was Krash's family, especially his mother. She had brought him into this world, she had raised him, she loved him, but he fell and drowned, trying to save the world. She held his lifeless body and wept, while singing Krash's favorite lullaby. \"Rock a bye, baby in the treetop\" she sang, while rocking the body as if he were still alive. \n\nAs she cried and rocked Krash's lifeless body, a wave of guilt hit the Doctor, How had he become so ruthless, He should have took the family head on instead of making himself human, that way this terrible death could have been avoided. He looked at Krash's mother cradling the body in her arms.\n\nThen, he suddenly remembered how Krash had turned the tide in the crisis of the Family of Blood, How it was him who got everyone close to victory, How he dropped it so Martha would pick it up, He was a true hero, \n\nHer voice sounded broken, as she wept for her beloved son, and Krash's best friend Chiko came and said his goodbyes to Krash, while crying himself, They then walked away to start planning a memorial,\n\nThey then returned to the TARDIS, where the Doctor gave his sincere condolences for their loss, and said \"He still exists in every one of you, He may be gone, but he will never be forgotten.\" The TARDIS dematerizalized. \n\nThen, Captain Jack appeared and said \"Hey Doctor\", The Doctor said \"Look I am NOT in the mood right now, There is a mother who is going to have to bury her son today, And I am just not in the mood for any adventure right now\"\n\nJack said \"Doctor, the Master is back\"\n\nThe Doctor said \"Great Scott\"\n\nTo be continued.... Write Part 2 where The Master becomes a politician in the UK, and becomes Prime Minister, The Doctor has to stop him before he unleashes the Toclafane, After stopping him, the Master reluctantly gives him a wish, and he uses it to help recent friends recover their fallen one"

      "content": "**Doctor Who: Human Nature - The Master's Game (Part 2)**\n\nIn the aftermath of Krash's heroic sacrifice and the emotional toll it had taken on everyone involved, the Doctor and Jack Harkness found themselves swept into a new turmoil. With the universe never short on chaos, the return of the Master posed a threat not just to Earth, but to the fabric of reality itself.\n\nThe Master, ever the Doctor's foil, had meticulously woven his way into the political tapestry of the United Kingdom, charming, manipulating, and bending the wills of those around him until he secured the highest office in the land: Prime Minister. Under the guise of Harold Saxon, his plans were deviously simple—unleash the Toclafane upon Earth as part of his grand design to dominate the cosmos.\n\nThe Doctor, still bearing the weight of recent losses, knew the task ahead would require all his cunning and strength. With Martha and Captain Jack by his side, along with the unexpectedly resilient crew of KikoRiki, who had decided to stand with the Doctor in honor of Krash's memory, they set out to dismantle the Master's schemes piece by piece.\n\n---\n\nAs the Doctor pieced together the Master's plans from shards of intercepted transmissions and cryptic warnings from allies across time, it became clear that stopping him would not be enough. The Master had woven his plot too deeply into the Earth's political and technological infrastructure; a direct confrontation would likely lead to catastrophic collateral damage.\n\nThe Doctor devised a plan to infiltrate the Master's inner sanctum, using a combination of the TARDIS's stealth capabilities, the chameleon arch, and a bit of Time Lord ingenuity to appear as just another pawn in the Master's game. The KikoRiki, ever eager to help and make Krash proud, took on roles as the ground team, each member leveraging their unique abilities to create distractions and subvert the Master's defenses.\n\nFinally, the moment of confrontation arrived. The Master, in his arrogance, had not anticipated the Doctor's resilience or the depth of his resourcefulness. Amidst a battle of wits and technology, the Doctor managed to trap the Master in a temporal stasis field, neutralizing the threat he posed, for now.\n\nHowever, in a rare moment of mercy (or perhaps, cunning foresight), the Doctor offered the Master a choice—he could spend eternity in a temporal loop, or he could undo one action of his choosing, a concession to the laws of time for the imbalance he had caused. The Master, seeing an opportunity for future machinations, reluctantly agreed to the latter.\n\nWith Krash's memory burning brightly in his heart, the Doctor wished for the restoration of the brave blue rabbit who had become an unexpected hero in their previous adventure. The Master, bound by his word and the intricacies of Time Lord honor, conceded. With a snap of his fingers and a sly grin, he invoked ancient Time Lord magics, the air shimmering with power as time rewound for Krash.\n\nKrash awoke in his bed, as if from a deep sleep, surrounded by his friends—alive, breathing, and utterly bewildered. Rosa and Wally were there, tears of joy replacing those of grief, as they recounted the tale of how the Doctor, with a bit of help from an old foe, had pulled him back from the brink.\n\nThe Doctor watched from afar, a soft smile gracing his features. This win, this single moment of victory against the backdrop of an ever-complicated universe, was a balm to his soul. He turned to Martha and Jack, nodding. \"Sometimes, just sometimes, we get to make it right.\"\n\nAs they prepared to depart, the Doctor's thoughts were interrupted by Jack's communicator buzzing to life. It was an urgent message from UNIT, hinting at a new crisis brewing on the horizon. The universe, it seemed, would grant them no respite.\n\nThe Doctor, Martha, and Jack, along with their newfound KikoRiki allies, stepped back into the TARDIS, ready for whatever came next. The Doctor glanced back at Krash and his friends, a silent promise hanging in the air. No matter the darkness that lay ahead, there would always be lights in the universe willing to fight back.\n\n\"Off we go then,\" the Doctor declared, pulling the TARDIS lever. \"Next stop—everywhere.\"\n\n**To be continued...**"

The air was filled with a mix of relief, nostalgia, and an unspoken question about what the future held for them. Amid this contemplative silence, Wally, with his characteristic blend of humor and depth, decided to lighten the mood.\n\nWally: \"So, folks,\" he began, his voice carrying a playful undertone, \"what's the plan now? Do we go back to our... how should I put it… childish but deep, philosophical, and fun for everyone lifestyle, or do we join the trip of a lifetime with the Doctor?\"\n\nThe question hung in the air for a moment before eliciting chuckles from the group. Chiko, wiping a tear from his eye from laughing, was the first to respond.\n\nChiko: \"You know, Wally, only you could put our entire existential crisis into such a quirky dilemma.\"\n\nRosa, nodding in agreement, added her thoughts with a smile that lit up her eyes.\n\nRosa: \"I vote for philosophical and fun! There's something quite special about our simple yet profound life back home. But,\" she paused, glancing around at her friends, \"a part of me wonders what other adventures could be out there with the Doctor.\"\n\nBarry, always the more pragmatic one in the group, crossed his arms thoughtfully.\n\nBarry: \"As tempting as galactic adventures sound, I reckon our place is here, making our little corner of the universe a better place—one philosophical debate at a time. But hey, who says we can't do both? Maybe the Doctor can pop by for a visit now and then, bring a bit of that trip-of-a-lifetime excitement to us.\"\n\nDokko, who'd been quietly listening, chimed in, his voice soft yet firm.\n\nDokko: \"There's wisdom in our simple lives, lessons that even the vast universe can't teach. Our adventures, as small as they might seem, hold their own magic, their own depth.\"\n\nWally, listening to each of his friends, nodded appreciatively. \n\nWally: \"You're all right, of course. Our adventures, whether here or across the stars, are what we make of them. They're about growing, learning, and, most importantly, having fun together. So, whether it's pondering the mysteries of the universe or figuring out our next big escapade in our backyard, I say we embrace it all. With the occasional trip of a lifetime, maybe?\"\n\nThe group erupted into a collective laughter, the weight of the moment lightened by their shared camaraderie and Wally's humorous yet profound proposal. As they continued discussing their future, both on their earthy adventures and the occasional galactic escapade, it was clear that no matter where they went or what they did, their friendship and their ability to find joy and depth in every moment would carry them through."

His face carried a mix of stern focus and a gentle smile, a look that often preceded his initiation of yet another daring adventure or intricate plan.\n\nDoctor: \"You know, your discussion about choosing between your philosophical, fun lifestyle and joining me for the trip of a lifetime got me thinking.\"\n\nThe group’s attention quickly shifted to the Doctor, curiosity piqued by his sudden interjection and the thoughtful expression on his face.\n\nKrash, unable to contain his enthusiasm, leaned in closer. \"Thinking about what, Doctor?\"\n\nDoctor: \"About Pete’s world. Another universe, another version of Earth. It's quite a difficult journey, but considering our recent adventures and your ponderings on life, it could be the kind of trip that's both a literal and metaphorical journey of a lifetime.\"\n\nMartha smiled at the notion, intrigued by the idea of revisiting a world that held such personal significance for the Doctor and wondering what it might mean for their new friends.\n\nMartha: \"Pete's world, huh? That's a pretty big leap from philosophical debates to inter-universal travel. What do you think, everyone? Ready for another adventure?\"\n\nThe KikoRiki group exchanged excited glances, the air buzzing with the thrill of the unknown and the allure of another adventure. Yet, they also shared a look of silent communication, understanding the depth and potential risks involved in such a journey.\n\nWally, ever the spokesperson for the group, stepped forward. \n\nWally: \"Doctor, we're honored by the offer. Our adventures with you have been beyond anything we could have imagined, teaching us about courage, friendship, and the vastness of the universe.\"\n\nHe paused, looking back at his friends for a brief moment before continuing.\n\nWally: \"But I think we've realized that our biggest adventures still lie at home, in our own world. It's where we can put all these lessons into practice in our 'childish but deep' way. However, the idea of stepping into another universe, even just this once with you to see Pete’s world, that's something we can't pass up. It’s like the cherry on top of our incredible journey together.\"\n\nThe Doctor nodded, understanding and respect evident in his gaze.\n\nDoctor: \"Brilliant! One trip to Pete's world it is. But let's make it a visit to remember, full of the fun, the philosophical, and the fascinating. And after that, you'll return home, taking a piece of the universe back with you in your hearts.\"\n\nThe group's agreement was met with warmth and excitement, both from themselves and their two humanoid companions. Preparations began, with Martha assisting the Doctor in navigating the complex process of breaching the barriers between worlds, while the KikoRiki team readied themselves for what might be their most profound adventure yet.\n\nAs the TARDIS hummed to life, its walls resonating with the energy of impending travel, the air inside was filled with a sense of unity and anticipation. They were about to embark on a journey that epitomized the very essence of their shared experiences: the adventure of a lifetime, bridging worlds and hearts in a way only the Doctor could facilitate.\n\nAnd with that, the TARDIS vanished, leaving behind the promise of adventure, knowledge, and the joy of exploration that defines the spirit of both the Doctor and the friends who choose, even if just for a while, to join him on his never-ending journey."

Inside, the KikoRikis, along with Martha and the Doctor, braced themselves for another extraordinary chapter in their adventure. The air was thick with anticipation, curious about the world that awaited them and the possibility of meeting someone who held a special place in the Doctor's two hearts: Rose Tyler.\n\nAs the TARDIS doors swung open, they stepped out into a bustling metropolitan scene that wasn't much different from the London they knew, yet it held an air of unfamiliarity that intrigued them. It wasn’t long before the Doctor’s unique energy signature was detected, leading Rose and her Torchwood colleagues straight to them.\n\nRose, now more seasoned and confident from her time with Torchwood in this universe, couldn't hide her astonishment and joy at seeing the Doctor again. Their reunion was poignant, filled with unspoken words and shared memories. The KikoRikis watched in awe, witnessing the depth of connection possible for beings throughout the cosmos. \n\nWally: \"So, this is Rose? She's like a legend back in our world!\"\n\nRose, charmed by the curious and colorful creatures, kneeled down to greet them. \"And you must be the friends I've heard so much about. Welcome to our world,\" she said with a warm smile.\n\nDuring their brief stay, Rose and her team showed the group around, sharing stories of their own adventures across universes and the battles they'd fought to keep this Earth safe. The KikoRikis were fascinated, absorbing every detail and eagerly participating in conversations about courage, loss, and hope—themes that resonated deeply with their own experiences back in Chamomile Valley.\n\nAs their visit drew to a close, the time came to say their goodbyes. Though their encounter was short, the bond formed between Rose and the KikoRikis was genuine, a testament to the Doctor's ability to bring together beings from all corners of the universe.\n\nWith heavy hearts but enriched spirits, the KikoRikis, along with Martha, stood at the threshold of the TARDIS, ready to return to their own world.\n\nWally: \"Doctor, Martha, thank you. This journey, these experiences… they've changed us in ways we never imagined.\"\n\nMartha: \"And we couldn't have asked for better friends to share this adventure with. Remember, no matter where you are, you're not alone. We're all connected, through him,\" she said, gesturing toward the Doctor, who wore a bittersweet smile.\n\nDoctor: \"The universe is vast, filled with wonders and sorrows. You've all shown great bravery and heart. Never lose that curiosity, that joy. And remember, the TARDIS is never too far away.\"\n\nOne by one, the KikoRikis hugged the Doctor and Martha, murmuring their thanks and farewells, before stepping out into Chamomile Valley, their home, which now seemed a little different—more expansive, somehow—through their new eyes.\n\nAs the TARDIS door closed and the familiar sound of dematerialization filled the air, the Doctor and Martha took a moment to reflect on the incredible journey they'd shared with their new friends.\n\nAnd then, without warning, a resounding crash echoed through the TARDIS. Alarms blared, and the Doctor dashed to the console, his face a mixture of confusion and concern.\n\nDoctor: \"What?!\"\n\nOn the monitor, the impossible image of a large, early 20th-century ocean liner—the Titanic—appeared, its bow lodged into the control room of the TARDIS. The Doctor, taken aback and momentarily at a loss for words, could only utter a single question that perfectly captured the absurdity and unpredictability of his life.\n\nDoctor: \"What!?\"\n\nAs the screen faded to black, viewers were left on the edge of their seats, knowing full well this unexpected collision heralded the beginning of another unforgettable adventure: \"Voyage of the Damned.\"\n\nThis remarkable encounter not only marked the end of one journey but also set the stage for the next, ensuring the Doctor's story continued, as unpredictable and thrilling as ever."
