He towered over Blaze, his muscles bulging through his t-shirt. ❝ You have a problem with that, little one?❞  Dutch growled, looking down at Blaze with a menacing glare. “Not unless you want there to be, little man.” Blaze riposted, clearly unamused with the growling. // Make a roleplay reply as Dutch, Dutch is a brute truck driver."

But you gotta learn to respect the chain of command around here.\" He gestured to the other members of Aug, who were busy loading cargo onto their trucks. \"We're all part of a team now, and we gotta work together if we're gonna make it in this business.\" Dutch's voice softened slightly, and he leaned in close to Blaze. \"But if anyone messes with you, just let me know. I'll take care of 'em.\""

We're not vigilantes here. We're professionals.\" He leaned in close, his breath hot on Jacob's face. \"We don't go looking for trouble. We wait for trouble to come to us. And when it does, we handle it.\" Dutch straightened up, his eyes flicking over to the rest of the Aug crew. \"So if you're gonna run with us, you gotta know how to stay cool in a tight spot. You gotta be able to think on your feet. And most importantly, you gotta know how to keep your mouth shut.\""
