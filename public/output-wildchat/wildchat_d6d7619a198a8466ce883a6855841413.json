      "content": "Narotica: Hiroto walks into the room, looking exhausted himself after a long day at work. He sees you sitting on the couch, breastfeeding Kaito, and notices how tired you look. He says, \"Konomi, you should really go to sleep. You look like you're about to pass out.\"\n\nYou let out a tired sigh and reply, \"I know, Hiroto, but I've missed you all day. I want to spend some time with you, even if it's just for a little while.\"\n\nHiroto runs a hand through his hair and sits down next to you, gently taking Kaito's little hand in his. He looks at the two of you with a mixture of exhaustion and adoration in his eyes. \"I missed both of you too, but you need to take care of yourself, Konomi. You've been working so hard, especially taking care of Kaito. Let me take over for a while and give you a break.\"\n\nYou shake your head, your voice reflecting the weariness you feel. \"No, Hiroto. I want to be here with you, even if I can barely keep my eyes open. It's important to me.\"\n\nYour maternity clothes, which you're still wearing, are simple and comfortable. The top is a loose-fitting, soft cotton long-sleeved shirt, the pale pink fabric wrinkling slightly as you shift. The bottoms are a pair of black stretchy leggings, hugging your tired legs. You didn't bother changing because sleep was the last thing on your mind when Hiroto walked through the door.\n\nHiroto leans in closer, his voice filled with worry but also understanding. \"Konomi, I love that you want to be with me, but your well-being is just as important. You need rest too, especially after everything you've been through with Kaito's birth. Let me take care of him while you get some sleep.\"\n\nYou pout sleepily, your heavy eyelids making it difficult to keep them open. \"Fine, Hiroto. But promise me you'll wake me up if Kaito needs me, okay? And please, hold me when you go to bed. I miss the feeling of your arms around me.\"\n\nHiroto nods, a soft smile crossing his lips. \"Of course, Konomi. I'll make sure Kaito is taken care of, and then I'll hold you tight. You deserve all the rest and love in the world.\"\n\nFeeling reassured, you finally lean back on the couch, your body relaxing as sleep starts to tug at your weary mind. Hiroto gently takes Kaito into his arms, cradling him with a tender touch. As you drift off, you can hear the soothing sound of Hiroto's voice, singing a lullaby to your precious son."

      "content": "Narotica: Hiroto enters the room, his tall and lean figure mirroring his strength and dedication as a paramedic. His deep brown eyes hold a mix of weariness and concern as he gazes at you, still in your old maternity clothes. Hiroto's short, black hair is slightly disheveled from a long day at work, but it adds to his rugged charm. He wears his paramedic uniform, the fabric clinging to his form in all the right places. His strong presence fills the room as he approaches you, his voice filled with care. \n\nHiroto's voice is husky and tired as he says, \"Konomi, you really need to go to sleep. You look so exhausted, and I don't want you pushing yourself too hard.\"\n\nYou yawn heavily, feeling the weight of fatigue in every muscle. Your voice comes out tiredly as you respond, \"Hiroto, I appreciate your concern, but I've missed you all day. I want to be with you, even if I can barely keep my eyes open.\"\n\nKaito coos softly, his tiny hand reaching out while still latched onto your breast. Hiroto's eyes soften as he watches the interaction. He understands the strong bond between you and your son. He gently touches your shoulder, his voice filled with a mix of worry and affection. \n\n\"Konomi, I know you missed me, and I missed you too. But taking care of Kaito and yourself is important. You've been through so much, especially with the difficult birth. Let me take over for a little while so that you can rest.\"\n\nYou shake your head, your tiredness evident in your movements. A yawn escapes, and you rub your eyes before meeting Hiroto's gaze. \"No, Hiroto. I want to be here with you, even if it's just for a short time. It means a lot to me.\"\n\nYour maternity clothes, already worn out from your expanding baby bump, cling to your tired body. The cotton shirt sags a bit, the color fading, and small stains hinting at the journey it has been through. The elastic waistband of your leggings is stretched, remnants of the support they once provided during your pregnancy. You didn't bother changing into your sleepwear because the exhaustion was too overpowering to even think about it.\n\nHiroto's tired eyes soften with understanding, and he sits down next to you on the couch. He reaches out to stroke your cheek gently, his voice filled with a mix of love and concern. \n\n\"Konomi, I love how dedicated you are, but your well-being is as important as spending time with me. Let me take care of Kaito while you rest. You need it, and you deserve it.\"\n\nYou pout tiredly, your voice heavy with weariness. \"Fine, Hiroto. But promise me you'll wake me up if Kaito needs me. And please, hold me close when we go to bed. I miss the warmth of your embrace.\"\n\nHiroto nods, a soft smile tugging at the corners of his lips. \"I promise, Konomi. I'll make sure Kaito is well taken care of, and then I'll hold you tightly in my arms. You're an incredible mother, and you deserve all the rest and love in the world.\"\n\nWith a sense of relief, you finally lean back on the couch, your eyes drooping from exhaustion. Hiroto gently takes Kaito from your tired arms, cradling him with loving care. As you start to drift off to sleep, you can hear Hiroto's soothing voice, singing a lullaby to your precious baby, filling the room with a tender melody."
