      "content": "The 15th century King would likely be astonished and confused by the concept of time travel and the ability to freeze someone in time. Initially, he may suspect the time traveler of being a sorcerer or a servant of the devil. However, if the time traveler could demonstrate the frozen knight and explain the situation, the King may see it as a valuable weapon in his battles and would likely reward the time traveler for their service. The King may also be wary of the potential consequences of time travel and freezing people in time, and may ask the time traveler for more information about their abilities and the possible risks involved."

      "content": "The last part of the 15th century King's reaction to a time traveler freezing an enemy knight in time and bringing them to him would likely involve a deep curiosity and concern about the consequences of such an act. Time travel would have been a completely foreign and unimaginable concept to the King and his society, so it would be natural for him to be wary of the unknown and fearful of the power of the time traveler.\n\nUpon seeing the frozen knight, the King would likely marvel at the technology and magic involved in freezing someone in time. He would ask the time traveler many questions about their abilities and how the technology worked, perhaps imagining the ways it could be used to gain an advantage in his battles or gain power over his enemies. However, he would also be cautious and worried about the long-term effects of manipulating time and the possibility of altering history or causing unintended consequences.\n\nThe King would likely seek more information about the risks of time travel and the potential ramifications of removing someone from their own time period. He may ask if the time traveler has ever tried to unfreeze a person and what happened when they did. He may also want to know if there are other people who can time travel or if the time traveler is the only one with this ability. The King would likely weigh the potential benefits and risks of using this technology before deciding how to proceed."
