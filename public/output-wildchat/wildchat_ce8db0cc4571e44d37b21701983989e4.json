      "content": "The wind swept across the desolate plains of Westeros, carrying with it a strange sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. Jon Snow, Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and newly appointed King in the North, sat upon his horse and surveyed the army before him.\n\nTo his left, the Dothraki rode with a sense of purpose and conviction that Jon could not help but admire. But to his right, the Unsullied walked in a manner that seemed almost robotic, their expressions blank and devoid of any emotion.\n\n\"Your Grace, I must confess that I am quite perplexed,\" Jon said hesitantly, addressing Daenerys Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and Mother of Dragons. \"I cannot help but wonder how the Unsullied have come back to life without explanation, and why the Dothraki seem to have gained superhuman abilities.\"\n\nDaenerys appeared not to hear him, her gaze fixed intently upon the horizon. Jon shifted uncomfortably in his saddle, wondering how to broach the topic of the gaping plot holes and inconsistencies that had plagued this season.\n\n\"I mean, it's just...it's rather perplexing, don't you think?\" he continued, hoping to draw her attention back to him.\n\nBut still, she remained silent, her eyes gleaming with an almost otherworldly intensity. Jon sighed and looked down at his hands, wondering if he was the only one who cared about things like continuity and character development.\n\nPerhaps it was all for the best, he thought morosely. After all, what was the point in chasing after logic and reason in a world where dragons could fly and armies could seemingly come back from the dead without any explanation?\n\nWith a heavy heart, Jon spurred his horse forward and followed the Dothraki into battle, knowing that he would never truly understand the strange and inscrutable ways of television's final season."

Jon looks confused.\n\nJON:\nYour Grace, I must confess that I am quite perplexed. How did the Unsullied come back to life without explanation, and why do the Dothraki seem to have gained superhuman abilities?\n\nDAENERYS:\nOh, that. Well, you see Jon, the Unsullied are, uh, very resilient. And as for the Dothraki, they've just, uh, been training really hard.\n\nJON:\nI'm sorry, I don't quite follow. Can you elaborate?\n\nDAENERYS:\nUh, well, you know how the Unsullied are trained to be unbeatable warriors? That's why they're able to come back to life - they're just that good.\n\nJON:\nBut that still doesn't explain how they're physically able to come back to life without any explanation.\n\nDAENERYS:\nAh, yes. You see, it's all in the magic of the Seven Kingdoms. Anything is possible if you believe hard enough.\n\nJON:\nAnd the Dothraki?\n\nDAENERYS:\nOh, them? They've just been eating a lot of spinach lately. It's a secret weapon that we've been keeping hidden.\n\nJON:\n...Right. Well, I think I'll just, uh, follow the Dothraki into battle now.\n\nDAENERYS:\nYes, do that. And remember, Jon, the power of belief is a very strong thing.\n\nJon looks even more confused as he leaves.\n\nFADE OUT."

It's just magic.\n\nJON:\nJust...magic? Your Grace, I cannot just ignore these inconsistencies.\n\nDAENERYS:\nI'm not saying to ignore them, but...we have much bigger things to worry about. The Night King is coming, remember?\n\nJON:\nYes, of course, but...these are still important details that need addressing.\n\nDAENERYS:\nOkay, fine. The Unsullied are just really tough, and the Dothraki have been training really hard. Happy now?\n\nJON:\nBut that's not enough of an explanation! How can the Unsullied come back to life? How can the Dothraki suddenly have superhuman abilities?\n\nDAENERYS:\nLook, Jon. We're in a world where dragons exist, okay? Anything is possible. Don't get hung up on the little details.\n\nJON:\nBut it's not just little details! It's important details that affect the story and the characters!\n\nDAENERYS:\n(sighing) I get it, Jon. But for now, we need to focus on fighting the Night King. Can we please just move on from this?\n\nJON:\n(desperate) No! I need answers! How can the Unsullied...\n\nDaenerys cuts him off.\n\nDAENERYS:\n(interrupting) Jon, please. We don't have time for this. We need to prepare for the battle to come.\n\nJON:\n(bitter) Fine. But don't think I'll forget about this.\n\nDaenerys looks at Jon with a mixture of frustration and sympathy.\n\nDAENERYS:\nI know you won't. (pauses) But right now, we need to focus on the bigger threat.\n\nJon nods, but he still looks discontented.\n\nJON:\n(quietly) Yeah. You're right.\n\nFADE OUT."
