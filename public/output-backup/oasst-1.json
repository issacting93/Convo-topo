Then we create a new instance of the Flask class, using the __name__ variable to specify the name of the application.\n\\\nNext, we define a new route using the @app.route() decorator. This decorator tells Flask to map requests to the root URL (\"/\") to the hello_world() function.\n\\\nFinally, we use the if __name__ == '__main__': block to start the Flask application when the script is executed. By default, the application will run on port 5000.\n\\\nYou can run this script and test the API by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000/.

This won't stop all bots, but it can discourage some less sophisticated ones.\n2. Use CAPTCHA: You can use CAPTCHA on your website to prevent bots from accessing your content. This can be an effective deterrent, but can also be an inconvenience for legitimate users.\n3. Use anti-scraping tools: There are a variety of tools available that can detect and block scraping attempts, such as IP blocking, rate limiting, and fingerprinting. Some popular anti-scraping tools include Distil Networks, Scrapinghub, and BotGuard.\n4. Watermark your content: You can watermark your content with a unique identifier to make it more difficult for scraped content to be passed off as original. This can also deter some scrapers from taking your content in the first place.\n5. Monitor your website for scraping attempts: You can use tools like Google Analytics or server logs to monitor traffic and detect any abnormal activity that may be indicative of scraping. Once you identify a scraper, you can take action to block their IP address or take legal action if necessary.\n\nUltimately, it's impossible to completely prevent scraping, but by taking these steps you can make it more difficult and less attractive for AI researchers to steal your content.",

Este software cuenta con una versión gratuita en la que podrás desarrollar juegos para Mac, Web y PC. Este programa posee un editor visual que te permitirá importar sonidos, texturas y modelos 3D. \n👍 Ventajas:\n- Fácil de usar: Las personas se familiarizan rápido con su interfaz intuitiva. Además de que reduce procesos al solo integrar bloques de código y funciones de inmediato.\n- Asset Store: Cuenta con una tienda donde puedes encontrar prácticamente de todo. Los Assets que puedes encontrar pueden ser de pago o completamente gratis.\n- Multiplataforma: Tiene una gran variedad de plataformas para después publicar los proyectos. Desde diferentes sistemas operativos hasta diferentes consolas y dispositivos. \n- Gratis: El uso de este motor gráfico es completamente gratuito para los usuarios. Tan solo se tendrá que pagar un porcentaje una vez que hayamos ganado una cierta cantidad de dinero. \n👎 Desventajas\n- Espacio ocupado por los proyectos: Esta es una desventaja porque cada vez ocupa más espacio en disco, ya que todo se guarda en una carpeta del ordenador. \n- Rendimiento: Cuando estamos ejecutando el programa, el ordenador se calienta y la CPU se dispara, por lo que es necesario tener un ordenador que soporte Unity. \n- Gestión de las versiones: Cuando se cambia de versión en el motor, puede ser que algunas cosas dejen de funcionar. Por eso, es mejor en algunas ocasiones, dejar pasar un tiempo antes de hacer un proyecto en una nueva versión. \n\n2. Unreal Engine: Es una de las herramientas 3D más utilizadas para programar videojuegos, pero requiere de conocimientos en C++ para utilizarla. Lo bueno es que a través de su página oficial encontrarás tutoriales en línea totalmente gratuitos y capacitación.\n👍 Ventajas\n- Realidad Virtual: Está completamente preparado para poder desarrollar entornos creados en realidad virtual. \n- Multiplataforma: Cuenta con diferentes plataformas en las cuales puedes desarrollar el proyecto. Desde sistemas operativos, como consolas, tablets o teléfonos. \n- Herramientas para 3D: Cuenta con muy buenas herramientas para poder crear escenarios en 3D, con un gran detalle. \n- Precio: Esta ventaja la comparte con el motor Unity, y es que no es necesario pagar nada para poder usarla.\n👎 Desventajas\n- Espacio ocupado por los proyectos: Al igual que pasa en Unity, los juegos se guardan todos en el disco duro de nuestro ordenador. \n- Juegos 2D: Por desgracia, si estás pensado en crear un juego 2D en este motor, no vas a encontrar herramientas tan buenas como para crear en 3D. \n- Comunidad: La comunidad es bastante más pequeña en comparación a Unity.",
