She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?",
