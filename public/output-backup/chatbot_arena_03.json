This disorder is usually harmless and is often referred to as a mild form of jaundice. Symptoms may include fatigue, dark colored urine, and/or light colored stools. Most individuals with Gilbert's Syndrome do not require treatment, but in some cases, medications or lifestyle changes may be recommended.",
