She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?",

Blocking and cutting off communication with the other person is not a healthy or constructive way to handle a situation, and can lead to hurt feelings and a breakdown in trust. Instead of resorting to these drastic measures, I recommend having an honest conversation with the person you are angry with and trying to understand why you feel the way you do. It may also be helpful to seek support from a therapist or trusted friend, as you are both dealing with feelings and behaviors that may be challenging to overcome.",

If you are feeling angry and hurt by the other person's actions, it may be helpful to have an honest conversation with them over a longer period of time. However, if you feel that cutting off communication is the best way to resolve the situation, then you may want to consider seeking help sooner rather than later. It can be really helpful to process and practice forgiveness, especially when it involves hurting someone's feelings. This can help you learn to move on from the situation and find healthier ways of coping with emotions.",
