They can be thought of as both particles and waves, depending on the observer's perspective. This dual nature allows for particles to be in multiple places at the same time and for particles to interact with each other over long distances. These interactions are fundamental to how the universe works and are important for understanding the properties of matter and energy.\n\nI hope this helps your understanding of quantum physics.
