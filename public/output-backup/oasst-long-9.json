All the animals that crossed over to land were segmented and bilaterally symmetrical. A tube shaped colony of cells with sensory organs near the mouth has a direction of travel gives rise to a front and back. Being darker on the top than the bottom evades predators and grants left and right, breaking radial symmetry. One group evolved segments which were then free to specialise developing appendages, which were used to cross over to land multiple times, like in insects, arachnids, amphibians and fish. The ancestors of mollusks developed a foot muscle attached to the head, used to crawl along the floor. So nature didn't invent the wheel because animals didn't roll out of the sea, they crawled.",

Animals that have beneficial variations are more likely to reproduce and so beneficial genes become more prevalent over time. Usually these changes are small and gradual. For an animal to have wheels, it would be a very large change for several reasons. One of these is that most animals have a circulatory system that provides oxygen, nutrients and hormones to the body. In order to have a wheel that rotates on an axel, the wheel and axel must be disconnected so the wheel can rotate freely. There is no clear way for the circulatory system to provide nutrients to a wheel if it is completely separate from the axel. Any veins or other connections to it would become tangled up as it rotated. That is my best explanation as to why wheels haven't evolved in animals.",

The evolutionary process of developing a wheel is complex and would require several mutations in an animal’s physiology and behavior. Additionally, wheels are designed for flat surfaces and are not ideal for use in most natural environments, as they are not able to maneuver well on rough or uneven terrain. Furthermore, many animals rely on physical agility or swiftness to survive and avoid predators, and wheels would not be able to offer them the same level of mobility. Finally, animals would require a significant amount of energy to roll around on wheels, which would reduce their overall efficiency when moving through their habitat.",
