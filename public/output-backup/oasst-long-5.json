It is created using a private key, which is kept secret by the sender, and can be verified using a corresponding public key, which is shared with the recipient.\n\nThe process of creating a signature involves taking a hash of the message (or document) and encrypting it using the sender's private key. The recipient can then use the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and compare it to a newly calculated hash of the received message. If the decrypted signature matches the newly calculated hash, it means that the signature is valid, and the message has not been tampered with.\n\nTo validate a signature, the recipient first calculates a hash of the received message. Then they use the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and compare it to the calculated hash. If the two match, it means that the signature is valid and the message is authentic.\n\nIt is important to note that the public key can only be used to validate the signature, it cannot be used to create a signature or decrypt the message. Only the private key can be used to create a signature.",

The signature is a mathematical function that transforms the message into a unique code and is sent along with the message. The recipient can validate the signature by using the sender's public key to decrypt the signature and obtain the original code that was used to create it and then using the same mathematical function to create a new code from the received message.
