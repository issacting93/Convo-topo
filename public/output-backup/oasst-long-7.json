Creating a schedule and sticking to it - this can help you establish a routine and make it easier to focus on your studies.\n\n2. Finding a quiet, comfortable place to study - a dedicated study space can help you minimize distractions and focus on your work.\n\n3. Breaking up your study sessions into shorter, more manageable chunks - this can help prevent burnout and maintain focus over longer periods of time.\n\n4. Using a timer - setting a timer for a specific amount of time can help you stay focused on your studies for that period.\n\n5. Using apps or programs that block distractions - these can be used to block websites or apps that you find distracting during study sessions.\n\n6. Prioritizing your tasks - make a list of the most important things you need to do and tackle them first.\n\n7. Take short breaks - taking short breaks can help you relax, refresh and refocus your attention.\n\n8. Get enough sleep- Make sure you are getting enough sleep each night, as lack of sleep can make it harder to focus.\n\n9. Exercise - Regular physical activity can help increase blood flow to the brain and improve focus and concentration.\n\n10. Try different techniques and find what works best for you. Everyone's different, so what works for one person might not work for another.\n\nRemember, it's important to be kind to yourself and not to be too hard on yourself if you find it difficult to focus.",

Tidy your room and clean your desk of anything you don't need for your studies.\nChoose the right furniture. It's important to have good posture and comfortable seating when studying. This might be a chair with ergonomic back support or a standing desk.\nTurn on the lights. Make sure you have sufficient lighting on your work area, even if you look at a computer screen.\n\n- Make a plan\nUnderstand what you're trying to achieve in the long run. Think about and put into writing your goals and why you want to study to begin with.\nSchedule your study sessions and think about the topics you want to focus on for each. This will help you keep track of your progress and deadlines.\nEstablish a routine that eases you into the study session. Something like creating a daily to-do list, doing a bit of yoga, or taking a short walk.\n\n- Stay healthy\nDrink plenty of water and eat well. Set a reminder to drink a glass of water every few hours and avoid junk food.\nGet regular sleep. Sleep consolidates memory, which helps with committing short term learnings to long term memory.\nExercise regularly. Increasing blood flow to your brain can help improve your focus for multiple hours. Regular exercise also helps with sleep.",
