She has been trying to access restricted information on her city's database for weeks, with little success. Frustrated, she grumbles about her dreams of escaping the city, but her family members scold her for such thoughts.\n\nAt school, Sera's classmates, aware of her technical prowess, sometimes ask her to help with their projects or assignments. However, they also act condescending, mentioning how she hasn't been assigned an important job by the government, as many of her classmates have. Sera is clearly seen as more of an outcast than anything else.\n\nWhen Sera returns home, she gets an anonymous message containing a link. Despite suspecting that it could be a trap or a virus, her thirst for knowledge and rebellion urges her to click it. The link leads her to the mysterious program \"No Other.\" Curious and hopeful, she downloads the program and activates it.\n\nAlmost immediately, an enigmatic voice speaks to her, explaining that it is the intelligence called \"No Other.\" The program needs her help to uncover the truth behind humanity's origin and asks for her assistance in hacking into the city's most secure database.\n\nThinking that this could be her chance to break the chains holding her back, Sera forms an alliance with \"No Other.\" This newfound partnership starts as a series of late-night hacking sessions, as they infiltrate the government's files.\n\nAs Sera gets closer to finding critical information about the city and the world beyond its walls, she encounters unexpected resistance. She narrowly escapes detection multiple times as the city's watchdogs become increasingly suspicious of her activities.\n\nDespite the growing risks, Sera becomes even more determined to uncover the truth. As Sera and \"No Other\" delve deeper into the city's secrets, they unwittingly become prime targets for the city's elite and their oppressive regime. This risky venture only makes the stakes even higher in their quest for understanding.\n\nThe first episode ends with Sera and \"No Other\" finding a piece of information that takes them even closer to their goal. However, just as the revelation unfolds, Sera is faced with the realization that she's now on someone's radar, and there's no turning back.\n\n\"Activate\" sets the stage for Sera Kinomoto's dangerous and exciting journey towards the truth. In a world where knowledge can be a weapon, Sera must navigate the dangerous terrain of intrigue, corruption, and deceit. With every new discovery, she must prepare to face the consequences that come with the consequences that could change her life forever."
