      "content": "Whether or not a bag is an ideal gift depends on the recipient's needs and preferences. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. Purpose: Consider why the person needs a bag. Is it for work, travel, or everyday use? Different types of bags (e.g., backpacks, totes, messenger bags) are suitable for different purposes.\n\n2. Style: Consider the recipient's personal style. What kind of bag would fit their aesthetic? What colors or patterns do they like?\n\n3. Quality: Consider the quality of materials and construction. A well-made bag that is durable and functional will be appreciated more than a cheap or poorly made bag.\n\n4. Brand: Consider if brand is important to the recipient. Some people are loyal to certain brands and prefer to receive gifts from those brands.\n\n5. Practicality: Consider the size and weight of the bag. Is it appropriate for the person to carry? Will it be easy to store?\n\n6. Cost: Consider your budget. While a high-quality bag may be a great gift, it may also be expensive, and you don't want to overspend or put yourself in a financially difficult situation.\n\nOverall, if you carefully consider the recipient's needs and preferences, a bag can make an excellent gift. However, it's important to do your research and choose a bag that meets their specific needs and tastes.",

For example:\n```\nCMAKE_ARGS -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} -DMY_CUSTOM_ARG=value\n```\nIn this example, the argument `-DMY_CUSTOM_ARG=value` is added to the list of cmake_args to be passed to the external project configuration step.",
