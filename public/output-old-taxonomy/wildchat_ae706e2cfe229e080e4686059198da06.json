      "content": "1. Remembering (Knowledge Level):\nQ: What is the cost of electricity in South Africa?\nA: The cost of electricity in South Africa varies depending on the consumption. However, on average, the cost ranges between R1.50 to R2.00 per kilowatt-hour.\n\n2. Understanding (Comprehension Level):\nQ: How do illegal electricity connections in South Africa affect the economy?\nA: Illegal electricity connections have a negative impact on the economy. These connections lead to power theft, which results in revenue losses for the electricity provider. This loss affects the overall infrastructure development and maintenance.\n\n3. Applying (Application Level):\nQ: Discuss a renewable way to generate electricity and how it can benefit South Africa.\nA: One renewable way to generate electricity is through solar power. South Africa has abundant sunlight, and harnessing solar energy by installing solar panels can provide a sustainable source of electricity. This can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, lower carbon emissions, and contribute to a more environmentally friendly energy sector.\n\n4. Analyzing (Analysis Level):\nQ: How does the illegal connection of electricity impact legal electricity supply in South Africa?\nA: Illegal electricity connections create an overload on the electrical network, leading to power outages and frequent disruptions in the legal electricity supply. This negatively affects households, businesses, and essential services relying on lawful electricity connections.\n\n5. Evaluating (Evaluation Level):\nQ: What are the potential consequences of relying solely on non-renewable sources of electricity in South Africa?\nA: Relying solely on non-renewable sources of electricity, such as coal or fossil fuels, can have severe consequences. These include environmental pollution, depletion of natural resources, and contribution to climate change. It also makes the country vulnerable to fluctuations in fuel prices and limited energy security.\n\n6. Creating (Synthesis Level):\nQ: Propose a sustainable solution to combat illegal electricity connections in South Africa.\nA: One potential solution could be raising awareness and educating communities about the risks and drawbacks of illegal electricity connections. Additionally, implementing stricter penalties for power theft and increasing access to legal, affordable electricity can incentivize people to avoid illegal connections and make use of legal and safer alternatives."

      "content": "Closing Interactive Activity: Electricity Solutions Game\n\nInstructions:\n1. Divide the class into small groups of 4-5 students.\n2. Provide each group with a set of colored cards or sticky notes (red, green, blue, yellow).\n3. Explain that each color represents a different concept related to mains electricity: \n\n   - Red: Cost of Electricity in South Africa\n   - Green: Illegal Electricity Connections in South Africa\n   - Blue: Renewable Ways to Generate Electricity\n   - Yellow: Any Key Term related to Mains Electricity\n\n4. Set a timer for 2 minutes.\n5. Each group should brainstorm as many ideas or terms related to their assigned color concept as possible.\n6. After the time is up, ask each group to share one idea or term from their brainstormed list.\n7. Write down these ideas or terms on the board or a flipchart.\n8. Repeat steps 5-7 for each color concept, allowing each group to contribute one idea or term.\n9. Once all the concepts have been discussed, lead a collaborative discussion by asking open-ended questions, encouraging students to make connections between the concepts:\n\n   - How do the cost of electricity and illegal connections impact the South African communities?\n   - Can renewable ways of generating electricity help reduce the cost of electricity for South Africans?\n   - Why are illegal electricity connections harmful to the environment and society as a whole?\n   - How can the government and communities work together to promote renewable energy sources?\n\n10. Encourage students to think critically and offer solutions or actions to address the challenges related to the cost of electricity, illegal connections, and renewable energy.\n11. Close the activity by summarizing the main points discussed and emphasizing the importance of understanding these concepts for a sustainable future.\n\nNote: You may adjust the duration of the activity and modify it based on the number of students and available resources."
