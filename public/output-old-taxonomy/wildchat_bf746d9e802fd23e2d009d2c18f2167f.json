And my princes shall no more oppress my people, but they shall let the house of Israel have the land according to their tribes.\"\n\nEzekiel 46:16 (ESV): \"Thus says the Lord God: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons as his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons. It is their property by inheritance.\"",

And the pots in the house of the Lord shall be as the bowls before the altar. And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the Lord of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day.\"\n\nThis passage is part of the concluding verses of the book of Zechariah, describing a future \"day of the Lord\" when there will be holiness and devotion to God esteemed even in ordinary things like horses' bells and pots. It suggests a time of complete dedication and consecration to the Lord, where everything will be set apart for His purposes. Furthermore, it mentions that everyone will have access to the sacred vessels for boiling sacrifices, symbolizing a restoration of worship and unity among the people. Lastly, it states that there will no longer be any dishonest or corrupt individuals in the house of the Lord.",
