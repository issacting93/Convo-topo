      "content": "The golden butterfly portfolio is a type of investment portfolio that is designed to provide investors with exposure to a variety of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and gold. The goal of the portfolio is to provide investors with a balanced mix of assets that will help them to achieve their investment goals.\n\nThe golden butterfly portfolio is made up of three main asset classes: stocks, bonds, and gold. Stocks are shares in companies, and they represent ownership in those companies. Bonds are loans that investors make to governments or companies, and they pay interest over time. Gold is a precious metal that has been used as a store of value for centuries.\n\nThe golden butterfly portfolio is designed to provide investors with exposure to all three of these asset classes. This helps to reduce risk, as one asset class may perform well while another asset class performs poorly. For example, if stocks are performing poorly, bonds may be performing well, and gold may be performing even better. This can help to offset the losses in stocks and provide investors with a positive return on their investment.\n\nThe golden butterfly portfolio is also designed to be a long-term investment strategy. This means that investors should not expect to see significant returns in the short term. However, over the long term, the golden butterfly portfolio has the potential to provide investors with significant returns.\n\nHere are some examples of golden butterfly portfolios with UCITS accumulating ETFs for short, medium, and long term investment:\n\nShort-term golden butterfly portfolio:\n\n* 25% iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (Acc) (IWD.L)\n* 25% iShares Core Euro Government Bond UCITS ETF (Acc) (IE00B103ZF29)\n* 25% iShares Gold Trust ETF (IAU.US)\n* 25% iShares Core US Dollar Currency Hedged Government Bond UCITS ETF (Acc) (IE00B3Q5Y932)\n\nMedium-term golden butterfly portfolio:\n\n* 33% iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF (Acc) (IWD.L)\n* 33% iShares Core Euro Government Bond UCITS ETF (Acc) (IE00B103ZF29)\n* 33% iShares Gold Trust ETF (IAU.US)\n\nLong-term golden butterfly portfolio:\n\n* 50",

However, over the long term, the golden butterfly portfolio has the potential to provide investors with significant returns.\n\nFor example, the golden butterfly portfolio has returned an average of 10.1% per year over the past 10 years. This is significantly higher than the average return of the S&P 500, which has returned an average of 7.1% per year over the same period.\n\nThe golden butterfly portfolio has also outperformed the MSCI World Index, which has returned an average of 8.6% per year over the past 10 years.\n\nThe golden butterfly portfolio is a long-term investment strategy, and investors should not expect to see significant returns in the short term.
