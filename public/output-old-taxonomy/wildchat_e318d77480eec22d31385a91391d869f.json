The issue seems to be with the line \"If Not mIsSubmitted Then Exit Sub\". Since mIsSubmitted is a Boolean variable, it will always have a value (either True or False). Instead of checking if it is not True, you should check if it is False. Modify the CopyMatchingValues subroutine as follows:\n\nSub CopyMatchingValues()\n    Dim mIsSubmitted As Boolean\n    Dim StaffForm As New StaffForm1\n    \n    ' Show the UserForm as a modal dialog\n    StaffForm.Show vbModal\n    \n    If Not StaffForm.IsSubmitted Then Exit Sub\n    \n    Call CopyMatchingContinue\nEnd Sub\n\nNow, when you click the SUBMIT button in the form, it will set the IsSubmitted property to True, and the CopyMatchingContinue subroutine will be called.\n\nPlease try these modifications and let me know if it solves the issue.",
