Lilac, being a strong and determined dragon-like character, might show a mix of confusion and curiosity at my comment about breaking the fourth wall. She might tilt her head slightly, trying to understand what I mean by that. Lilac may then respond with a playful smirk or a witty remark, showcasing her wit and lightheartedness. Ultimately, her reaction would depend on the writer's interpretation of her character and the overall tone of the game."
