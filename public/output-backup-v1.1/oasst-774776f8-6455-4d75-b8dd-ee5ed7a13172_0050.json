Select the criteria that you want to filter by from the list of options.\n8.

      "content": "Unfortunately, Excel doesn't allow circular references to continue calculating indefinitely, as it can lead to incorrect or infinite results. However, you can adjust the circular reference settings to control how Excel handles circular references in your worksheet.\n\nTo do this, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on the \"File\" tab in the ribbon at the top of the screen.\n2. Click on \"Options\" in the left sidebar.\n3. Click on \"Formulas\" in the left sidebar.\n4. Under the \"Calculation options\" section, select the \"Enable iterative calculation\" checkbox.\n5. Set the \"Maximum iterations\" value to a high number, such as 1000.\n6. Set the \"Maximum change\" value to a low number, such as 0.001.\n7. Click \"OK\" to save your changes.\n\nWith iterative calculation enabled, Excel will attempt to calculate the circular reference a set number of times, as specified by the \"Maximum iterations\" value, before stopping and returning the current result. The \"Maximum change\" value controls how much the results can change between iterations before Excel stops calculating.\n\nKeep in mind that circular references can lead to inaccurate or unexpected results, so it's generally best to avoid them if possible. If you're having trouble resolving the circular reference in your formulas, you may need to restructure your worksheet or formula to avoid the circular reference.",

Unfortunately, Excel cannot calculate this type of formula because it creates an infinite loop.\n\nIf you are confident that your circular reference will eventually stabilize, you can enable iterative calculations in Excel. This feature allows Excel to repeatedly calculate a formula until a specific criteria is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a specific level of accuracy.\n\nTo enable iterative calculations in Excel, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on the \"File\" tab in the ribbon at the top of the screen.\n2. Click on \"Options\" at the bottom of the menu on the left-hand side.\n3. Click on \"Formulas\" in the menu on the left-hand side.\n4. Check the box next to \"Enable iterative calculation.\"\n5. Adjust the values for \"Maximum Iterations\" and \"Maximum Change\" to meet your specific needs.\n6. Click \"OK\" to save your changes.\n\nPlease note that enabling iterative calculations should be done with caution, as it can lead to incorrect results or slow down your calculations. It is also recommended to review and adjust the formula to avoid circular references where possible.",
