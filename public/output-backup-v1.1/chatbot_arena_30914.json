The phrase is often used to describe someone who is strong and powerful, but also someone who is sly and takes advantage of others.",

If C finished before D, then C started eating before D started eating.\n3. If A finished before C, then A started eating before C started eating.\n4. If B finished after A, then B started eating after A started eating.\n5. If D finished after B, then D started eating after B started eating.\n6. If E finished after D, then E started eating after D started eating.\n\nUsing these statements, we can deduce the finishing order of the five people as follows:\n\n1. Since A finished before B, and B finished after A, then B finished after A started eating.\n2. Since C finished before D, and D finished after B, then D started eating after B started eating.\n3. Since A finished before C, and C finished before D, then C started eating before D started eating.\n4. Since B finished after A, and A finished before C, then B finished after C started eating.\n5. Since D finished after B, and B finished after A, then D finished after A started eating.\n6. Since E finished after D, and D finished after B, then E finished after B started eating.\n\nTherefore, the finishing order of the five people eating apples is: E, D, C, B, A.",
