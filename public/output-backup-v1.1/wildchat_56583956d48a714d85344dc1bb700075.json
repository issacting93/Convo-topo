I would like to enhance the page to accommodate mixed cabins view, where customers can see all the different combinations available.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n1.

When I click on the \"Mixed Cabin\" tile, a dropdown or popup window should appear displaying the different cabin combinations.\n3. There should be a total of six combinations: Economy + Business, Economy + First, Business + Economy, Business + First, First + Economy, and First + Business.\n4. Each combination should have a brief description highlighting the benefits and amenities offered.\n5. Upon selecting a particular combination, the corresponding fare for that combination should be displayed prominently.\n6. The selection of a fare should be made easy and intuitive for both web and mweb (mobile web) users.\n7.
