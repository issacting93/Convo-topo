The superhero look began on Jan 1 and the rest is history. Write a continuation forum convo where a user said they remember posting on a forum at the time saying it was horrible to kill off your mascots before rebranding",

I was active on a forum back then and I remember posting about how it was horrible to kill off the mascots like that before the rebranding. It was such a shock to see them disappear like that, especially with the spooky Halloween campaign. But looking back now, I see why they made the change. The superhero theme has definitely been a hit with the kids.\n\nUser3: Yeah, I remember feeling the same way when the anthropomorphic animals disappeared. It was such a bold move by the channel, but I have to admit, the superhero theme really grabbed my attention. It's funny how a rebranding can completely change the feel of a channel. But those old idents with the animals will always hold a special place in my heart. \n\nUser1: It's interesting to see how our perspectives have changed over time. I was so sad to see the mascots go, but now I can appreciate the creativity behind the new superhero theme. It's definitely a memorable chapter in the history of Ultra Kids. Who would have thought a simple rebranding could spark such a discussion?",

They were so upset about the disappearance of the mascots, and their little heart was broken thinking they had been killed off. When we received a response from the channel, my kid was sad at first. But then they read the line, \"A super new look is coming, so be ready to save the day,\" and their whole face lit up with excitement. It was such a relief to see them go from sadness to anticipation in a matter of moments. The power of a simple message, right? \n\nUser2: That's so sweet! It just shows how much these characters mean to children. I can only imagine the joy your kid felt when they read that line about the new superhero look. It's moments like those that make me appreciate the impact of children's programming even more. It's not just about the shows, but the whole experience and connection that kids have with these channels. \n\nUser3: Absolutely, it's amazing how children can become so attached to these characters and channels. I love hearing stories like that where a simple message or moment can turn sadness into excitement. It just goes to show the power of storytelling and how it can bring joy and comfort to kids. The superhero theme really brought a new energy to Ultra Kids, and it's great to see it resonate with the young audience.",
