The user is prompted to enter their name with the \"Enter your name:\" message. Then, the \"printf\" function is used to print a personalized greeting to the user, using the value stored in the \"name\" variable.\n\nCompiling and running the program is the same as before. Note that the size of the \"name\" array should be one more than the maximum number of characters you want to allow, as it needs to store the null terminator character.",
