      "content": "summarize: After Carter took office in 1976, it became clear that his approach to foreign policy differed from Richard Nixon\u2019s realpolitik. Whereas Nixon had prided himself on his realism, Carter emphasized idealism in foreign affairs and insisted that the government not separate foreign policy from \u201cquestions of justice, equity, and human rights.\u201d \u201cFairness, and not force,\u201d Carter urged, \u201cshould lie at the heart of our dealings with nations of the world.\u201d\n\nPromoting Justice, Equality, and Human Rights Carter struggled to realize his foreign policy ideals. He was successful in resolving certain issues, like establishing a more equitable relationship with Panama. Panamanians had long regarded a 1903 treaty between the two countries, which gave the United States permanent control over the Panama Canal, as unjust. In 1977, Carter negotiated a treaty to return control of the canal to Panama in 1999. Despite strong objections, the Senate ratified the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978.\n\nThe degree of Carter\u2019s success in human rights policy was more varied. At the start of his presidency, Carter was determined to end the United States\u2019 Cold War tendency to support dictators who opposed communism even if they abused human rights. When leftist rebels in Nicaragua ousted the country\u2019s anticommunist dictator in 1979, Carter adhered to his policy of non-intervention. However, he continued to support dictators with poor human rights policies in other parts of the world\u2014including the Philippines and Indonesia\u2014that Carter believed were vital to U.S. interests.\n\nThe Camp David Accords ended hostilities between Egypt and Israel. Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt over the course of four years. In exchange, Egypt formally recognized Israel as a country.

In exchange, Egypt formally recognized Israel as a country.\n\nA Step Toward Middle East Peace: The Camp David Accords Carter\u2019s greatest foreign policy achievements were in the Middle East. In 1978, he invited the leaders of Egypt and Israel to commence peace talks at Camp David, a presidential retreat in Maryland. Egypt and Israel had been adversaries in the Yom Kippur War of 1973, during which Israel gained control of land that had previously belonged to its neighbors. Israel\u2019s occupied territories included Egypt\u2019s Sinai Peninsula.\n\nAt Camp David, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat conversed for 13 tense days. Finally, they reached an agreement called the Camp David Accords, which provided a framework for peace between the two countries. Israel agreed to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, and Egypt agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Egypt became the first Arab country to formally recognize Israel as a country, which Arab nations had opposed since Israel\u2019s establishment in 1948.\n\nIn 1979, Sadat and Begin jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to end hostilities between their countries. Presenting the award, the chairman of the Nobel Committee spoke of Carter\u2019s work, claiming the president was \u201cthe master builder responsible for the bridge\u201d that brought \u201ctwo one-time enemies\u201d together to talk of peace.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter shakes hands with Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin after the Camp David Accords were signed on September 17, 1978. The Accords established diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt. The agreement also marked a high point in Carter\u2019s Middle Eastern peace efforts.

The agreement also marked a high point in Carter\u2019s Middle Eastern peace efforts.\n\nThe Death of D\u00e9tente Between the United States and USSR As president, both Nixon and Ford pursued a policy of d\u00e9tente toward the USSR. Carter openly criticized the Soviet Union\u2019s human rights record, but cooperated with Soviet leaders to negotiate a second Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II). In a speech before the United Nations, Carter stated, \u201cPeace will not be assured until the weapons of war are finally put away.\u201d\n\nD\u00e9tente efforts dissolved when Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in 1979 to assist the country\u2019s failing communist government in subduing a rebellion. Deeming this invasion the \u201cmost serious threat to world peace since World War II,\u201d Carter promoted a boycott of the Olympic Games, which was scheduled to be held in Moscow the following summer.\n\nA Hostage Crisis in Iran The Nixon Doctrine fared little better than d\u00e9tente during Carter\u2019s presidency. As part of the Nixon Doctrine\u2019s policy, the United States increased military aid to Iran in the 1970s. In return, the United States expected Iran\u2019s royal ruler, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, to help maintain stability in the Persian Gulf. Carter continued to support the Shah, despite his poor human rights record, until a revolution swept through Iran in January 1979. Under a religious leader, the Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini, the revolutionary army declared Iran a republic and forced the Shah into exile. Khomeini then established a new government based on strict adherence to Islamic principles.\n\nLater that year, Carter allowed the exiled Shah to enter the United States for medical treatment, enraging many Iranians. On November 4, 1979, militant students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran\u2019s capital. In violation of international law protecting diplomats, the students took 66 Americans hostage. They paraded the hostages through the streets of Tehran, where an angry crowd shouted, \u201cDeath to Carter!\u201d\n\nCarter struggled to bring the hostages home for over a year. Appeals to the United Nations and other U.S. allies for assistance in securing the hostages\u2019 release accomplished little, so Carter ordered a military rescue in April 1980. The mission failed when two helicopters had engine trouble, a third was damaged while landing, and a fourth crashed, killing eight Americans.\n\nThe Iran hostage crisis erupted when Iranian students seized Americans working in Tehran\u2019s U.S. embassy. As the crisis persisted, many Americans criticized Carter over his failure to bring the hostages home. They viewed Carter\u2019s inability to free the hostages as indicative of the United States losing power.\nThe Iran hostage crisis erupted when Iranian students seized Americans working in Tehran\u2019s U.S. embassy.

      "content": "summarize: Earth Day\u2019s success prompted the emergence of a grassroots environmental movement. Some groups, such as the Audubon Society and the Sierra Club, had existed for many years. The Sierra Club was founded in 1892, under the leadership of John Muir and other conservationists, to enjoy and protect the mountains of the West. Over time, the club expanded its mission to include preserving wilderness and protecting the environment throughout the nation. In the 1970s, the Sierra Club\u2019s membership expanded from 100,000 to nearly 200,000 people.\n\nIn addition, new organizations were created to respond to environmental concerns. Some dealt with local problems, such as cleaning rivers and establishing recycling programs, while others focused on national and global issues. A group called Zero Population Growth (ZPG) formed in 1968 to raise awareness of rapid population growth\u2019s role in accelerating environmental destruction. With the slogan \u201cStop at Two,\u201d ZPG encouraged families to stay small.\n\nA Decade of Environmental Legislation In response to increasing public concern, Congress enacted a number of environmental laws during the 1970s. Soon after the first Earth Day in 1970, Congress approved legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which aimed to repair existing environmental damage and to prevent further destruction. The EPA grew quickly\u2014by the end of the decade, it had become the government\u2019s largest regulatory agency, comprising over 10,000 employees.\n\nAir pollution was a major environmental concern during the 1970s. In 1970, Congress amended the Clean Air Act of 1963, setting stricter emissions standards for automobiles, factories, and power plants. In 1977, lawmakers amended the act again, this time to strengthen air-quality standards.\n\nCongress also addressed the issue of water pollution. In 1969, Americans were shocked when the polluted Cuyahoga River burst into flames in Cleveland, Ohio. The Clean Water Act of 1972 limited the amount of sewage and other pollutants flowing into waterways, while the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 enabled the EPA to regulate public drinking water quality.\n\nThe EPA also worked to eliminate another source of water pollution, called acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation that contains acid as a result of water vapor mixing with molecules of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen in the atmosphere. These pollutants are released into the atmosphere by automobiles, factories, and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Acid rain can harm plants and animals and is powerful enough to corrode buildings and other stone structures.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the EPA set limits on car pollution levels. By 1975, manufacturers were equipping cars with catalytic converters, devices that remove pollutants from cars\u2019 exhaust. In 1979, the EPA required that coal-fired power plants use smokestack scrubbers to remove exhaust pollutants. This technology was widely adopted in the 1980s.\n\nEnvironmental Disasters Fuel Public Concern Two well-publicized environmental disasters in the 1970s underscored public concern about environmental hazards. The first of these incidents occurred in Love Canal, a neighborhood in Niagara, New York. Love Canal residents unknowingly lived atop a chemical waste dump, exposing them to poisons. As a result, residents developed unusually high rates of cancer and birth defects. When officials uncovered the root of the community\u2019s health problems in 1978, Love Canal became a media storm. The federal government eventually relocated 800 Love Canal families to safer areas, while Congress passed laws requiring companies to thoroughly clean their toxic waste sites.\n\nThe second disaster of the decade occurred at Pennsylvania\u2019s Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station. On March 28, 1979, the nuclear power plant suffered a partial meltdown. Although the situation was eventually controlled, some radioactive gases escaped into the atmosphere. The Three Mile Island accident convinced many Americans that nuclear power plants posed an unacceptable risk to human beings and the natural environment. No new nuclear power plants have been built in the United States since 1979.\n\n",

The EPA became the largest regulatory agency in the government and addressed issues such as air pollution, water pollution, and acid rain. Two environmental disasters, the Love Canal toxic waste dump and the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident, further fueled public concern, culminating in laws requiring companies to clean toxic waste sites and the halt of new nuclear power plant construction in the US.",
