I am contacting you today to bring to your attention an issue I encountered with Naviance, specifically regarding an email communication that I believe did not successfully go through.\n\nRecently, I was expecting to receive an email from Naviance, but unfortunately, it seems that I never received it. I wanted to inform you about this situation as it may have implications for our ongoing correspondence and any necessary actions related to my college applications.\n\nI have checked my email inbox thoroughly, including spam and trash folders, but no email from Naviance regarding [specify the subject or purpose of the email] was found. As a result, I am concerned that there might have been a technical glitch or an error during the email sending process.\n\nConsidering the importance of efficient communication during college application season, I thought it best to clarify this matter promptly. I kindly request your assistance in ensuring that I receive any necessary information or updates related to my applications through alternative means until this issue is resolved.\n\nPlease let me know if there is any additional information I can provide to help resolve this matter swiftly. I appreciate your attention and understanding regarding this situation and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nThank you for your continuous support and guidance throughout this college application process.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]"
