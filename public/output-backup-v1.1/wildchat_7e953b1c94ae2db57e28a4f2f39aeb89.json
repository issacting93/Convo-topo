However, it's worth noting that using regex to parse HTML/XML is not always reliable and can lead to unexpected results. It's better to use a specialized XML/HTML parsing library instead.\n\nAlso, if you want to exclude tables in Flutter specifically, you may need to adjust the regex accordingly based on the particular structure and syntax used in Flutter."
