There are plenty of online resources and books available to help with this.\n\nLearn an instrument or experiment with music software. If you don't already know how to play an instrument, consider taking lessons or finding online tutorials. Alternatively, you could experiment with music software such as GarageBand or Ableton to create your own music.\n\nStudy the production process. This includes learning about the different roles involved in music production, such as producers, sound engineers, and mastering engineers. You could also learn about the different types of equipment used in the studio, and how to use software to produce music.\n\nCollaborate with other musicians. Working with others can be a great way to learn about the creative process and gain new perspectives. You could join a band, participate in online communities or attend local music events.\n\nAttend workshops or classes. Look for opportunities to learn from experienced musicians or attend music production workshops to learn new skills and techniques.\n\nKeep practicing and experimenting. Creating music is a continual process of learning and experimentation, so keep practicing and trying out new ideas.",

This could also be your voice if you aren't familiar with any other instruments.\n\nNext, select a riff or segment of melody either from a piece of music that you like and use that as your base to develop the rest of your piece of music.\n\nTry to imagine several variations of melody that could follow the first line of melody. Then, select one that you think opens possibilities for the music to continue in interesting ways. Use a form of notation to commit your work to a page you can reference later.\n\nAs you proceed with this process, expanding your piece segment by segment, keep the original riff in mind and try to find ways to return to that theme. Doing this will make the entire work seem cohesive. Experiment with progressions that leave a sense of tension and feel like they need to be resolved by future bars. Play with the tempo and rhythm of notes.\n\nOnce you feel your new piece of music has reached its desired length, you'll typically want to resolve the tune by ending on the same note you started on.",
