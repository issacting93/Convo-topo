There is a lack of hope and confidence in themselves, and they are struggling to make progress. The music also seems to be evoking a sense of vulnerability and authenticity.\nIt's important to remember that everyone experiences challenges and struggles in life. It's normal to feel ashamed, lost, and sometimes even broken. However, it's also important to remember that life goes on and there is always a way to make progress and overcome obstacles. It's important to stay positive and work towards building a better future for yourself.",
