Here's an easy LeetCode-style question for you:\n\nGiven a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single number.\n\nYou may assume that there will always be one odd-occurring element in the array, and your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. You should also implement it without using extra memory.\n\nPlease write a function called `singleNumber` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the single number.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: `nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`\n\nOutput: `4`\n\nYou can ask any questions to clarify the problem, and when you're ready, you can provide your code implementation.",
