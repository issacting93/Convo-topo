The first, \"Theo's Try Hard\", is about a person named Theo who is trying hard to achieve success, with a focus on his determination and persistence. The second, \"The Oldest House\", is about an old house that is full of mystery, secrets, and tales untold, and is considered a symbol of history and the past.\n\nThe third poem, \"SCP-6112\", is different from the first two in that it is about the SCP Research Facility, a site dedicated to exploring and containing anomalies and unknown subjects. The poem uses mathematical concepts and set theory to describe the various parts of the SCP Research Facility and their properties, while also describing the facility's purpose, secrets, and influences.\n\nExample 4: \"The Endless Horizon\"\n\nThe horizon stretches far and wide,\nIts bounds unknown, its beauty untried.\nWith every step, it seems to grow,\nAn endless vista, a breathtaking show.\n\nThe sky above, a canvas so grand,\nWith hues of blue, and colors so bland.\nThe sun sets slowly, with a fiery gleam,\nAnd the stars twinkle, like a million dreams.\n\nThe sea below, a symphony of sound,\nWith crashing waves, and tides so round.\nIt whispers secrets, of lands unseen,\nAnd calls to mind, a world serene.\n\nThe horizon, a symbol of the unknown,\nAn invitation, to explore and roam.\nWith each step forward, a new adventure,\nAnd a journey, to a future so pure.",
