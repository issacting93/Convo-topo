      "content": "As an AI language model, I don't have complete information about the function to describe the average bounce of a kicked rugby ball. However, in general, the trajectory of the rugby ball and the nature of its bounce primarily depend on the force and direction with which the ball is kicked, the speed at which it travels, the surface on which it lands, and the spin and shape of the ball. Therefore, the function describing the average bounce of a kicked rugby ball is likely to be complex and based on several factors mentioned above."

      "content": "A rugby ball after a grubber kick may seem to bounce higher every three bounces due to a phenomenon called resonance. Resonance occurs when a force is applied at regular intervals to an object, which causes the object to vibrate at its natural frequency. In the case of a rugby ball, the ball's natural frequency of vibration is related to its shape, size, and the elasticity of the materials used to make it.\n\nWhen a rugby ball is kicked with a certain force and spin, it starts bouncing on the ground. The first few bounces follow the normal pattern, but as the ball continues to bounce, it starts to vibrate at its natural frequency, which corresponds to the timing of every third bounce. As a result, the ball gains energy from the ground with each successive bounce, causing it to bounce higher every third bounce.\n\nThis phenomenon can be observed not only in rugby balls, but also in other objects such as musical instruments, pendulums, and even bridges. In the case of a rugby ball, the resonance effect can be amplified if the ball is kicked on a particular surface that matches its natural frequency, such as a hard and smooth surface like concrete or artificial turf."
