Here's a brief explanation of their differences:\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI):\nAI is a broader concept that refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This includes tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and speech recognition. The main goal of AI is to create intelligent agents or systems that can interact with their environment, adapt to changes, and perform tasks autonomously.\n\nMachine Learning (ML):\nML is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. In other words, ML is the process of training a model using data to identify patterns or relationships, which can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. This is achieved without being explicitly programmed to do so. Some common ML techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\nIn summary, AI is a broader field that encompasses various approaches to create intelligent systems, while ML is a specific technique within AI that focuses on using data-driven algorithms to learn and make predictions or decisions.",
