In this project, I led a team of four members in creating a comprehensive restaurant ordering and internal resource management system. Taking on the responsibility of system design, I crafted front-end prototypes and meticulously developed and tested front-end functionalities to ensure a seamless user experience. To facilitate effective data visualization, I judiciously utilized the Echarts chart library. This project not only showcased my technical skills but also refined my leadership, communication, and problem-solving abilities.\n\nAnother project that highlights my technical prowess is the Beautiful Hometown Special Product Sales System, where I served as the team leader. This system effectively addressed the issue of surplus agricultural products while meeting the increasing demand for green organic food. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Node.js, ElementUI, and Sequelize, our team created a user-friendly and visually captivating system. I spearheaded the front-end development of all user-facing pages and meticulously crafted the back-end functionalities for seamless and reliable transactions. This project provided me with valuable experience in applying my technical acumen while enhancing my leadership and problem-solving skills.\n\nAdditionally, I have obtained various industry certifications, including the Java Software Development Intermediate Qualification Certificate and a series of Practical Training Certificates of Software Engineer. These certifications reflect my commitment to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest industry practices.\n\nFurthermore, my work experience as a data analyst and product manager has allowed me to sharpen my organizational and problem-solving skills. As a product manager, I successfully executed five projects through effective collaboration with cross-functional teams, demonstrating my adaptability and prioritization abilities in a dynamic work environment. As a data analyst, I implemented streamlined data collection and management processes, enhancing data accuracy and efficiency in generating analysis reports. I also developed interactive data visualization tools that empowered management with enhanced decision-making capabilities. These accomplishments received commendations from senior management, recognizing my attention to detail and commitment to upholding high data integrity standards.\n\nThrough these projects, certifications, and work experiences, I have acquired the necessary skills and knowledge required to excel in the MSACS program. I am confident in my ability to succeed based on past academic achievements, practical experience, and dedication to continuous learning.
