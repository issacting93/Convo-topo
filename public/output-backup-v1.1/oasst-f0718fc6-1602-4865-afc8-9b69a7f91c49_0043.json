Assuming the T-Rex is about the same size as Godzilla, it would only have its bite and tail to attack Godzilla with. His hide is known to be more or less immune to e.g. tank shells, so it is unlikely that the T-Rex's teeth would be able to damage him. Ultimately, Godzilla would probably destroy the T-Rex quite quickly.",

T-Rex being twice as high as Godzilla would would be 66 times its original hight. Mass of the object scales cubically, with object's  length. This means that T-Rex would weigh nearly 2 million tonnes. The biggest know living animal ever lived is a blue whale weighing up to 180 tonnes. Clearly, T-Rex, being this big, would suffer from a heart failure, wouldn't be able to support his weight and would probably overheat making him unable to fight Godzilla. Hence Godzilla would win by walkover.",

It would likely depend on the specific versions of both monsters, as well as the conditions of the battle and their abilities.
