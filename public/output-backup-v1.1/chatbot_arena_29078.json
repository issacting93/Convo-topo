For example, if the trend line is not a straight line or is not a good fit for the data, it can create the impression that the data is behaving differently than it actually is. Additionally, if the trend line is mis-scaled, it can also create misleading information.\n\nIt is important to use a trend line that accurately represents the underlying pattern in the data, and to make sure that the scale of the trend line is appropriate for the data.

A nonlinear trend line would be more appropriate in this case as it better represents the underlying pattern in the data.\n\nA nonlinear trend line can be estimated using a method called polynomial regression. Polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis that estimates a nonlinear equation to fit the data. It is based on the idea that the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable can be modeled as a polynomial function.\n\nWhen using a polynomial regression, it is important to select the degree of the polynomial function that best fits the data. Higher degree polynomials will result in a more complex relationship, but may not be necessary if the curve is simple.\n\nIt is also important to note that nonlinear trend lines are not always the best fit for the data, and it's important to consider the context of the data and the purpose of the graph, as well as any other information that might be relevant, in order to choose the most appropriate trend line.\n\nIn summary, if the trend is nonlinear, subtracting a linear trend line from the data can create a misleading graph.

Shaded regions: Shaded regions can be used to show the range of possible values for each data point, which can help to indicate the uncertainty in the trend line.\n3.

In fact, it is a common way to create a line of best fit, which is a linear equation that represents the relationship between the two variables in the data.\n\nWhen the trend line is subtracted from the data points, it can create a plot that shows the deviation of each data point from the trend line, which can help to indicate the uncertainty in the trend line. This can be particularly useful when the relationship between the two variables is non-linear, as a linear trend line may not accurately represent the underlying pattern in the data.\n\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that the residuals can be affected by the choice of the trend line model, for example, if the trend line is too steep or too flat, the residuals can be misleading.
