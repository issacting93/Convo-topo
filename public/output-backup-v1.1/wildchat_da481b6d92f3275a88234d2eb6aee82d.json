I want to make a match of the string \u201cAccl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX\u201d, the TEST_TEST_1 can be other content but it will always be Letters, numbers and _ symbo.

      "content": "Certainly! If you want to extract the portion of text that matches the pattern \"Accl ID = [Letters, numbers, and underscore]\" from an anchor tag string that looks like this:\n\n```html\n<a href = \"\">Accl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX</a>\n```\n\nYou would need to use a Regular Expression (regex) in JavaScript to match that pattern. Here is an example of how you could do that:\n\n```javascript\nfunction extractAcclId(inputString) {\n    // Regex pattern to match \"Accl ID = \" followed by letters, numbers and underscores\n    const regexPattern = /Accl ID = [\\w]+/g;\n\n    // Matches all instances of the pattern in the input string\n    const matches = inputString.match(regexPattern);\n\n    // The output will contain the matched parts joined by the separator if more than one match is found\n    return matches ? matches.join('') : '';\n}\n\n// Input string with anchor tag\nconst input = '<a href = \"\">Accl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX</a>';\n\n// Extracting the desired output\nconst output = extractAcclId(input);\n\nconsole.log(output); // Should print: \"Accl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX\"\n```\n\nThe `\\w` in the regex stands for \"word character\", which typically represents `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, including the underscore `_`. The `+` sign signifies that one or more of the preceding token (in this case word characters) are matched.\n\nDo note that this regex pattern will match all instances of \"Accl ID = \" followed by the defined characters until the next whitespace or non-word character. If the format of the input string changes, the regex will need to be adapted accordingly."

If you want to match and extract a substring from the provided HTML-like string and the substring is always expected to start with \"Accl ID =\" and contain letters, numbers, and underscores, here's how you can do it in JavaScript using Regular Expressions:\n\n```javascript\nfunction extractMatchedSubstring(inputString) {\n    // Define a regex pattern to extract the desired part. This pattern looks for 'Accl ID ='\n    // followed by any combination of alphanumeric characters and underscores until it hits a \n    // non-matching character or the end of the string.\n    const regexPattern = /Accl ID = [A-Za-z0-9_]+/g;\n\n    // Use 'match' function to find all occurrences that match the pattern in the input string\n    const matches = inputString.match(regexPattern);\n\n    // If there are matches, concatenate them to form the output\n    // Here, we assume that the 'Accl ID' segments are contiguous in the string.\n    let output = '';\n    if (matches) {\n        output = matches.join('');\n    }\n\n    return output;\n}\n\n// Input HTML-like string\nconst input = '<a href = \"\"> Accl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX</a>';\n\n// Extract string using the above function\nconst output = extractMatchedSubstring(input);\n\nconsole.log(output); // This will log: \"Accl ID = TEST_TEST_1Accl ID = XXX\"\n```\n\nIn the regular expression used above:\n\n- `\\s*` matches any whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.), and allows for none or multiple occurrences due to the asterisk `*`.\n- `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` matches one or more (`+`) occurrences of alphanumeric characters (`A-Za-z0-9`) and underscores (`_`).\n\nYou can test this script in a JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or Node.js, and it should give you the expected output."
