Google highlighted that the most capable Gemini Ultra model\u2019s performance exceeds OpenAI GPT-4\u2019s results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\nSpecifically, Gemini Ultra became the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU\u00a0(massive multitask language understanding) with 90% score, which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities.\nYesterday, Microsoft Research team revealed that OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model can beat Google Gemini Ultra when new prompting techniques are used. Last month, Microsoft Research revealed Medprompt, a composition of several prompting strategies that greatly improves GPT-4\u2019s performance and achieves state of the art results in the MultiMedQA suite. Microsoft has now applied the prompting techniques used in Medprompt for general domains as well. According to Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model when used with a modified version of Medprompt achieves\u00a0the highest score ever achieved on the complete MMLU. Yes, OpenAI GPT-4 can beat the upcoming Gemini Ultra model by just by using the prompting techniques. This shows that we have not yet reached the full potential of already released models like GPT-4.\nTake a look at the benchmark comparison between GPT-4 (improved prompts) and Gemini Ultra models below.\nBenchmarkGPT-4 PromptGPT-4 ResultsGemini Ultra ResultsMMLUMedprompt+90.10%90.04%GSM8KZero-shot95.27%94.4%MATHZero-shot68.42%53.2%HumanEvalZero-shot87.8%74.4%BIG-Bench-HardFew-shot + CoT*89.0%83.6%\u00a0DROPZero-shot + CoT83.7%82.4%HellaSwag10-shot**95.3%87.8%\nFirst, Microsoft applied the original Medprompt to GPT-4 to achieve the score of 89.1% in MMLU. Later, Microsoft increased the number of ensembled calls in Medprompt from five to 20, which lead to the increased score of 89.56%. Microsoft later extended Medprompt to Medprompt+ by adding a simpler prompting method and formulating a policy for deriving a final answer by integrating outputs from both the base Medprompt strategy and the simple prompts. This led GPT-4 reaching a record score of 90.10%. Microsoft Research team mentioned that Google Gemini team was also using similar prompting technique to achieve the record scores on MMLU.\nYou can learn more about prompting techniques Microsoft used to beat Gemini Ultra here.\nMore about the topics: Gemini Ultra, GPT-4, microsoft, microsoft research\nPradeep Viswav\nSoftware and Services Expert\nPradeep is a technical manager at a large tech company and a seasoned technology blogger.
