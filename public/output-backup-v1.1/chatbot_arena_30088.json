Conversely, during the Miocene epoch (about 23-5 million years ago), Earth's climate was much cooler than it is today, and there may have been less atmospheric oxygen available.

In addition to environmental factors such as climate and atmospheric conditions, there are several other factors that could impact the evolutionary fitness of hemoglobin genes. These include genetic mutations, natural selection, and interactions with other genes and proteins in the body. For example, genetic mutations such as mutations in the hemoglobin gene itself could impact its function and evolutionary fitness by changing the structure or function of the hemoglobin protein. Natural selection is another important factor, as individuals with hemoglobin genes that are better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to future generations. Finally, interactions with other genes and proteins in the body can also impact the evolutionary fitness of hemoglobin genes, as changes in these genes can affect the function of hemoglobin and its ability to transport oxygen.",
