So far, the prevention and treatment of senile dementia are still the focus and difficulty of research. Given that neural changes in individuals who go on to develop dementia occur up to 2 decades before the onset of cognitive symptoms[], the emphasis is on shifting toward markers that permit early detection and treatment. We focus on the specific types and development mechanisms of dementias, relate its main ways, and provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of dementias.\u201d",

Senile dementia continues to be a major focus and challenge in research, both in terms of prevention and treatment. It is worth noting that neural changes occur up to two decades prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms, thereby emphasizing the need to shift the focus toward markers that enable early detection and treatment. In this regard, we aim to shed light on the various types and mechanisms of dementia, highlight its primary pathways, and introduce novel ideas for the prevention and treatment of this debilitating condition.",
