      "content": "The evolution of animation in Indonesia from 2010 until now has been significant. The industry has witnessed remarkable growth, with a focus on producing high-quality content that appeals to both domestic and international audiences.\n\nIn 2010, the animation industry in Indonesia was still at the early stages of development. There were relatively few animation studios, and most of the productions were limited to short films, TV commercials, and educational content. However, there was a growing interest in the industry, and several animation festivals and conferences started to emerge.\n\nAround 2012, there was a significant shift in the industry with the release of the first full-length feature film produced by an Indonesian animation studio. \"Battle of Surabaya,\" directed by Aryanto Yuniawan, marked a milestone in the Indonesian animation industry and showcased the potential of local talent. This film was praised for its quality animation and compelling storytelling.\n\nIn the following years, the animation industry in Indonesia experienced a surge in popularity. More animation studios were established, and the production of animated TV series, films, and web series increased. The rise of digital platforms and streaming services also provided a new distribution channel for animation content.\n\nOne notable animation studio that emerged during this period is BASE Entertainment. Founded in 2017, BASE Entertainment gained recognition for its computer-generated animation film \"Gundala,\" a superhero movie adapted from a popular Indonesian comic book. The film received both critical acclaim and commercial success, further boosting the reputation of Indonesian animation.\n\nThe animation industry also expanded its target audience beyond children. Animations with more mature themes, targeting teenagers and adults, started to gain popularity. Shows like \"BoBoiBoy\" and \"Beyblade Burst Turbo\" showcased the growing diversity of content in Indonesian animation.\n\nAdditionally, the industry has benefited from collaborations with international studios. For example, the Indonesian animation studio LCG Entertainment collaborated with Japanese anime studio Production I.G to produce the animated feature film \"Gibiate,\" which was released in 2020. Such collaborations not only enhance the quality of Indonesian animation but also provide opportunities for Indonesian animators to learn from their international counterparts.\n\nToday, Indonesian animation continues to flourish. The industry has demonstrated its potential in creating high-quality content that appeals to global audiences. With ongoing advancements in technology and increased investment in animation education, the future of Indonesian animation looks promising."

There were limited animation studios and the productions were primarily focused on short films, TV commercials, and educational content.\n\nHowever, this period marked a growing interest in animation among Indonesian artists and aspiring animators. Several animation festivals, conferences, and workshops were organized, providing a platform for animators to showcase their work, learn from industry professionals, and network with others in the field.\n\nThe year 2010 also saw the release of several notable Indonesian animated films. One such film was \"Meraih Mimpi,\" directed by Misbach Yusa Biran. It was a musical adventure film that aimed to promote cultural appreciation and education among children. While it may not have gained significant commercial success, \"Meraih Mimpi\" served as an important stepping stone in the growth of Indonesian animated feature films.\n\nIn terms of television animation, the animated TV series \"Si Bolang\" gained popularity during this time. It was a comedy series that followed the adventures of a mischievous young boy and his pet monkey. The show resonated with Indonesian audiences and became a hit, showcasing the potential for animated content in the country.\n\nDespite the relatively small scale of the industry in 2010, there were indications of the growth to come. The passion and dedication of Indonesian animators, along with the introduction of new technologies and animation techniques, laid the foundation for the subsequent evolution of the animation industry in Indonesia."
