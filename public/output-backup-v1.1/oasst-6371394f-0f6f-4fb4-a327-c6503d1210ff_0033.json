As caffeine is an addictive substance, most people will naturally take as much of it as they can until they feel uncomfortable taking more, suggesting that on average higher amounts are more likely to cause discomfort. However a proper probability cannot be given until you take into account all the other things that have changed from when you did not feel nauseous and bloated. Once you have identified all the changes that have occurred that can lead to you feeling unwell, you will be able to assign a probability to the caffeine. Alternatively, you can experiment with taking your previous level of caffeine. If your symptoms decline, it is highly likely the caffeine was the problem. Ultimately, through experimentation by stopping activities you have recently changed to the activities which you did previously, you should be able to find the cause of your discomfort.",
