It is a measure of the increase in elevation that occurs over a horizontal distance of 100 feet.\n\nTo calculate the distance traveled at a 10% grade, you can use the following formula:\n\ndistance = (height change) \\* (slope) \\* (100 / 100)\n\nFor example, if the height change is 100 feet and the slope is 10%, the distance traveled would be:\n\ndistance = (100 / 100) \\* (10 / 10) \\* 100 = 1000 feet\n\nThis means that at a 10% grade, a horizontal distance of 100 feet would result in a vertical increase of 1000 feet.",
