This ensures that at least one update domain is always available for your virtual machines. \n\nTo calculate the minimum number of virtual machines that will be available after a planned update, you need to first determine how many update domains are required for each virtual machine to be updated. In this case, there are 27 virtual machines and 5 update domains, so each update domain will contain 6 virtual machines with one update domain containing only 3 virtual machines.\n\nDuring the update process, the update domains will be updated one after the other, starting with update domain 1. This means that at any point in time during the update process, the number of virtual machines available will be the total number of virtual machines in all update domains up to and including the current update domain being updated.\n\nSo, after the update of the first update domain, the number of available virtual machines will be 21 (6 in update domain 1, 6 in update domain 2, 6 in update domain 3, and 3 in update domain 4). The same is true for the update of the second update domain. After the update of the third update domain, the number of available virtual machines will be 15 (6 in update domain 3 and 3 in each of update domains 1 and 2). Finally, after the update of the fourth update domain, the number of available virtual machines will be 9 (3 in each of update domains 1, 2, and 3). Once all update domains have been updated, all 27 virtual machines will be available again.",
