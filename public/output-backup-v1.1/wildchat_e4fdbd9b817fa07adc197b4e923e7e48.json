Victoria laughed awkwardly and quickly made an excuse to leave. David felt humiliated and frustrated with Stella's behavior, but he couldn't seem to confront her about it.\n\nLittle did David know, Stella had been using hypnosis on him whenever he felt upset or angry, causing him to become docile and submissive. He found it difficult to stand up for himself and speak his mind around her.\n\nDespite the embarrassment and discomfort he felt, David continued to work at the cafe, hoping to find a way to break free from Stella's hypnotic influence."

They caught up on old times, sharing stories and laughing over cups of coffee.\n\nJust as they were about to say their goodbyes, Stella walked over. \"Hey, David,\" she said with a smirk. \"Is this your new girlfriend?\" Victoria looked confused, but David blushed and shook his head.\n\nStella continued, \"I was just telling my staff how easy it is to hypnotize you. Watch this, David.\" She snapped her fingers, and David immediately looked dazed and compliant.\n\nVictoria was taken aback by Stella's behavior. \"What's going on? Are you okay, David?\" she asked, concerned.\n\nDavid tried to speak but found that his words came out slurred. \"I'm fine, Victoria. Stella's just...good at hypnotizing people, I guess.\"\n\nBut Victoria wasn't convinced. She noticed that all the staff members seemed to be under Stella's control, and it made her uncomfortable. She said a quick goodbye to David and left, feeling uneasy about the whole situation.\n\nDavid felt embarrassed and ashamed that he couldn't stand up against Stella's power. He knew he needed to find a way to break free from her grip and regain his independence."
