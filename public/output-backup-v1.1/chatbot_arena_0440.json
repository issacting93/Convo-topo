The first meaning is \"to constitute or form\" and the second meaning is \"to fabricate or invent\". \n\nThe joke sets up the expectation that scientists don't trust atoms for a serious reason, but then subverts that expectation by revealing that the reason is because atoms make up everything. This is unexpected and humorous because it's a pun that relies on the double meaning of \"make up\", and it's also a bit silly to think that scientists wouldn't trust something that makes up everything in the universe.",

It sets up the expectation that the joke will be similar to the original one, but then subverts it by adding the tennis ball and changing the punchline. The humor comes from the fact that dogs love tennis balls and will chase after them, but they can't catch atoms because they are too small. The punchline is also a pun that relies on the double meaning of \"catch\", which can mean to capture or to comprehend. Overall, the joke is lighthearted and silly, and relies on the audience's familiarity with dogs and their love of tennis balls.",
