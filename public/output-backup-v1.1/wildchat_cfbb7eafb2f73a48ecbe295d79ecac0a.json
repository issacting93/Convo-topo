      "content": "To maintain the current values of fields that a user is not allowed to edit themselves while still updating their profile based on the fields they are allowed to modify, you'll need to make a few adjustments to your PHP script. The main idea here is to fetch the current user data and only update the fields the user can edit. If any non-editable fields are part of the form submission, you should ignore these and use the current values from the database instead. \n\nLet's refactor your update logic considering that the user is not allowed to edit `exmne_package`, `exmne_both`, `exmne_subscription`, `exmne_expiry`, and `exmne_status` directly, and we'll assume these should be maintained as is in the database without being affected by the form submission:\n\n```php\ninclude(\"../../../conn.php\");\n\n// Ensure the user is identified.\n$exmne_id = $_POST['exmne_id'];\nif (empty($exmne_id)) {\n    echo json_encode([\"res\" => \"noID\"]);\n    exit;\n}\n\n// Fetch the current data for the user.\n$stmt = $conn->prepare(\"SELECT * FROM examinee_tbl WHERE exmne_id=:exmne_id\");\n$stmt->bindParam(':exmne_id', $exmne_id, PDO::PARAM_INT);\n$stmt->execute();\n$currentUser = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\nif (!$currentUser) {\n    echo json_encode([\"res\" => \"userNotFound\"]);\n    exit;\n}\n\n// Data from the form.\n$exFullname = $_POST['exFullname'];\n$exEmail = $_POST['exEmail'];\n$exPhone = $_POST['exPhone'];\n$exPass = $_POST['exPass'];\n$exPass2 = $_POST['exPass2'];\n\n// Password matching and hashing.\nif ($exPass !== $exPass2) {\n    echo json_encode([\"res\" => \"passwordMismatch\"]);\n    exit;\n}\n$hashedPassword = password_hash($exPass, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);\n\n// Update query maintains the values not editable by the user.\n$updCourse = $conn->prepare(\"UPDATE examinee_tbl SET exmne_fullname=:exFullname, exmne_email=:exEmail, exmne_phone=:exPhone, exmne_password=:hashedPassword WHERE exmne_id=:exmne_id\");\n$updCourse->execute([\n    ':exFullname' => $exFullname, \n    ':exEmail' => $exEmail, \n    ':exPhone' => $exPhone, \n    ':hashedPassword' => $hashedPassword, \n    ':exmne_id' => $exmne_id\n]);\n\nif ($updCourse->rowCount() > 0) {\n    echo json_encode([\"res\" => \"success\", \"exFullname\" => $exFullname]);\n} else {\n    echo json_encode([\"res\" => \"failed\"]);\n}\n```\n\nA few key points in this refactor:\n1. **Data Validation**: Added a check to ensure `exmne_id` is provided. This is critical for updating the right user profile.\n2. **Fetch Current User Data**: Before updating, it fetches the current user data. This step is crucial if you want to preserve the current values of fields not supposed to be edited by the user.\n3. **Password Handling**: It uses `password_hash` for hashing the password, which is a best practice for security. Ensure the hash is compatible with your login mechanism.\n4. **Maintaining Non-editable Fields**: The update query now only includes fields that the user is meant to edit. The other fields (`exmne_package`, `exmne_both`, `exmne_subscription`, `exmne_expiry`, `exmne_status`) are not part of this update statement, assuming these are not supposed to be edited through this form.\n\nBefore deploying these changes, ensure to test thoroughly, especially the password handling part to make sure it aligns with your login logic concerning password verification."
