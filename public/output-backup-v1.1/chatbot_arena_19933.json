The `` on_message `` event is used to check if the message received is a command, and if so, it formats the channel name with underscores instead of spaces to avoid issues with special characters, and sends a response message to the channel using the `` channel.send `` method.\n\nTo use this script, you will need to replace `` TOKEN_HERE `` with your own Discord bot token. You can obtain a token by going to the Discord Developer Portal and creating a new application. Once you have obtained a token, you can use it in the script as shown above.\n\nNote that this is just a very basic example to get you started with the `` discord.py `` library. In a real-world application, you would likely want to add more functionality and error handling to your bot, as well as add more commands and responses to handle a wider range of user input.",
