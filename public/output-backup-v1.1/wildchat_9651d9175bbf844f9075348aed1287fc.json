Here are two other methods:\n\nMethod 1: Using the LEAST and GREATEST functions:\n\n```\nSELECT \n   LEAST(eats_first_trip_date__c, eats_last_trip_date__c) AS from_month,\n   GREATEST(eats_first_trip_date__c, eats_last_trip_date__c) AS to_month\nFROM table\n```\n\nThe LEAST function returns the smallest value from a list of expressions, while the GREATEST function returns the largest value from a list of expressions. In this case, we're passing two columns as arguments to both functions, so it will return the minimum and maximum of those two columns.\n\nMethod 2: Using UNION and aggregate functions:\n\n```\nSELECT MIN(dates) AS from_month, MAX(dates) AS to_month\nFROM (\n   SELECT eats_first_trip_date__c AS dates FROM table\n   UNION ALL\n   SELECT eats_last_trip_date__c AS dates FROM table\n) subquery\n```\n\nThis method uses a UNION operation to combine the values from the two columns into a single column called \"dates\". The subquery then applies the MIN and MAX functions to that column to get the minimum and maximum values."
