It uses a loop to iterate through all possible numbers (up to 1000), and for each number, it checks if it is divisible by each of the given divisors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). If it is not divisible by any of the divisors, then it returns that number. Otherwise, it continues to the next number. If all possible numbers have been checked and none of them are divisible by any of the divisors, then it returns -1.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(1000^2) which is not efficient, as the number of iterations is much higher than the number of divisors.
