SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n\nJane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose walk down the hallway, chatting and laughing.\n\nJANE\nSo, did you guys hear about this new student coming to our school? I wonder if they're cool.\n\nSAM\nI heard it's the daughter of that big department store owner in town. Julia Fairbanks, I think?\n\nAARON\nJulia Fairbanks? Oh yeah, I know her. She's always on those TV commercials for Fairbanks's.\n\nMOLLY-ROSE\nYeah, she's basically a local celebrity. I've seen her and her dad on billboards too. They're loaded, you know?\n\nThey reach the entrance of the school auditorium where all the students are gathering.\n\nJANE\nThere she is! Look, Sam, that's Julia and her dad.\n\nSam squints and points to the stage where Julia and her father stand.\n\nSAM\nWow, her dad is right there too! Must be nice to have your father introduce you to the whole school.\n\nAARON\nHey, she's starting her speech. Let's listen.\n\nJULIA\n(Onstage, with enthusiasm)\nHello, everyone! I'm Julia Fairbanks, and yes, my dad is the owner of Fairbanks's. I'm sure you all know the store.\n\nThe auditorium resonates with nods and murmurs of recognition.\n\nJULIA (CONT'D)\nYou see, I am the biggest daddy's girl in the entire world! I'm proud of it, too.\n\nJane and Sam exchange amused glances, while Aaron laughs softly.\n\nJULIA (CONT'D)\nAnd that's not all! I have something special to show you all.\n\nJulia reaches into a box she brought onstage and reveals a handful of frogs.\n\nJULIA (CONT'D)\nTa-da! My adorable pet frogs. I just can't get enough of them. They're like my little green babies.\n\nMolly-Rose's eyes widen in fascination, as she leans closer to get a better look.\n\nMOLLY-ROSE\nThey're so cute! I've never seen someone bring frogs to school before.\n\nJULIA\n(Continuing)\nOh, and guess what? I'm a huge fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and the SCP Foundation. They're my obsessions right now.\n\nThe crowd gasps with surprise and intrigued whispers spread throughout.\n\nJANE\n(to Sam, whispering)\nShe's into some interesting things, huh? I didn't expect that.\n\nSAM\n(laughing)\nDefinitely not your typical \"rich girl\" hobbies. Julia seems pretty down-to-earth.\n\nAARON\n(with a smile)\nWell, you never know what a person is like until you get to know them. Maybe she's more than just a \"daddy\u2019s girl.\"\n\nThey listen intently as Julia continues her speech, the energy in the auditorium buzzing with curiosity and anticipation.\n\nFADE OUT."

      "content": "JULIA\n(Excitedly)\nOh, and let me tell you about my two favorite SCPs! First, there's SCP-173, also known as \"The Sculpture.\" It's this creepy-looking statue that can only move when nobody is looking at it. It's like playing a real-life game of hide-and-seek!\n\nThe students in the auditorium exchange intrigued glances, seemingly captivated by Julia's unique interests.\n\nJULIA (CONT'D)\nAnd then there's SCP-529, or as it's commonly called, \"Josie the Half-Cat.\" It's this adorable creature with a feline head and tree-like limbs. I can't help but awe at its strangeness and cuteness all at once.\n\nMolly-Rose's eyes widen again, a mixture of fascination and slight unease filling her expression.\n\nMOLLY-ROSE\nWow, those SCPs sound really interesting. I've heard about them, but I didn't know anyone who was a fan like you, Julia.\n\nJULIA\n(Grinning)\nI'm glad I'm not alone in my fascination! The SCP Foundation's stories and creatures give me a sense of mystery and adventure. It's like stepping into a whole different world.\n\nAaron looks at Julia with newfound respect, his curiosity piqued by her unexpected interests.\n\nAARON\nYou know, Julia, you're not at all what I expected. You seem really cool and down-to-earth, despite being the daughter of a successful businessman.\n\nJULIA\n(Laughs)\nThanks, Aaron! I guess people often have preconceived notions about me because of my family's wealth. But I'm just a regular teenager with quirky interests like everyone else here.\n\nJane and Sam nod in agreement, the initial assumptions they had about Julia fading away.\n\nJANE\nYou're right, Julia. It's easy to judge someone based on appearances, but what matters is the kind of person you are on the inside. And you're definitely cool in our book.\n\nSAM\nTotally! And the fact that you're a Sonic fan just makes you even cooler.\n\nJulia beams, feeling accepted and understood by her newfound friends.\n\nJULIA\nThanks, guys. It means a lot to me. I'm excited to get to know all of you better and be part of this school's community.\n\nAs the auditorium bursts into applause, Jane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose join in, embracing a new friendship and breaking the barriers of first impressions.\n\nFADE OUT."
