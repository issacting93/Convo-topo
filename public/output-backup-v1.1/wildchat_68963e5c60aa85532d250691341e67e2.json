      "content": "No, the statement \"if f and g are not bijective, then g\u2218f is not bijective\" is not true in general. The composition of two functions that are not bijective can sometimes result in a bijective function, although this is typically not the case.\n\nTo understand why, let's review the definitions:\n\n- A function f is **injective** (or one-to-one) if f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f.\n- A function f is **surjective** (or onto) if for every y in the codomain, there is at least one x in the domain such that f(x) = y.\n- A function is **bijective** if it is both injective and surjective.\n\nFor the composition g\u2218f to be bijective, it must be both injective and surjective. It is possible, under certain conditions, for the composition to be bijective even if neither f nor g is bijective. Here are some scenarios:\n\n1. **Injectivity**: If the range of f is a subset of the domain of g where g behaves injectively (even if g is not injective on its whole domain), then g\u2218f can be injective.\n\n2. **Surjectivity**: If g is surjective onto the range of f (even if f is not surjective), the composition g\u2218f can be surjective.\n\nTo understand this better, consider an example with three sets A, B, and C, and functions f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 C.\n\nLet's say f is surjective but not injective (so there is more than one element in A pointing to any given element in B), and g is injective but not surjective (so elements in C may have no pre-images in B). If the range of f completely covers the domain of g where g is injective, and g maps this range onto the entirety of C, then g\u2218f could be bijective.\n\nHowever, in general, if both f and g are not injective, or both are not surjective, the composition g\u2218f will usually inherit these restrictions and also not be bijective. Each case depends on the specific properties of f and g and how they interact when composed."

      "content": "Certainly! Let's look at a concrete counterexample where both f and g are not bijective, but their composition g\u2218f is bijective.\n\nLet's consider the sets A = {1,2}, B = {3,4,5}, and C = {6,7}. Now, define the functions f: A \u2192 B and g: B \u2192 C as follows:\n\nf(1) = 3\nf(2) = 4\n\ng(3) = 6\ng(4) = 7\ng(5) = 6 (or anything else, since g(5) is irrelevant to our composition)\n\nNow, analyze the bijectiveness of each function:\n\n1. **Function f** is not surjective since no element in A is mapped to 5 in B. However, it is injective because it maps distinct elements of A to distinct elements in B.\n\n2. **Function g** is not injective since it maps both 3 and 5 to the same element in C (6). However, it is surjective since every element in C has a pre-image in B (either 3 or 4).\n\nNow, let's examine the composition g\u2218f for elements in A:\n\n(g\u2218f)(1) = g(f(1)) = g(3) = 6\n(g\u2218f)(2) = g(f(2)) = g(4) = 7\n\nWe can see that g\u2218f is:\n\n- **Injective**: Each distinct element in A is mapped to a distinct element in C.\n- **Surjective**: Every element in C is the image of some element in A through the composition g\u2218f.\n\nTherefore, the composition g\u2218f is a bijective function, even though neither f nor g is bijective by themselves. So, this counterexample disproves the initial statement."
