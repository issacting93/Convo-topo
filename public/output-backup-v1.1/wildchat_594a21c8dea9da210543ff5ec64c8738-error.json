      "content": "To solve this problem, it's important to understand the law of conservation of charge, which states that the total charge in an isolated system remains constant. When two conductive objects are brought into contact, charges redistribute between them until they each have the same charge density, which in the case of identical objects means each will end up with an equal share of the total charge.\n\nInitially, Sphere A has a charge of 10.4 C, while Spheres B and C are uncharged (0 C each).\n\n1. **First Contact between Sphere A and Sphere B:**\n\n   Sphere A has a charge of 10.4 C, and Sphere B has a charge of 0 C. When brought into contact, the total charge of 10.4 C is shared equally between them because they are identical spheres.\n\n   - Charge on Sphere A after contact = Charge on Sphere B after contact = Total charge / 2 = 10.4 C / 2 = 5.2 C.\n\n   So, after their separation, Spheres A and B each have a charge of 5.2 C.\n\n2. **Contact between Sphere B and Sphere C:**\n\n   Now, Sphere B with a charge of 5.2 C is brought into contact with uncharged Sphere C (0 C). Following the same principle, the total charge of 5.2 C will be equally shared between Spheres B and C.\n\n   - Charge on Sphere B after contact = Charge on Sphere C after contact = Total charge / 2 = 5.2 C / 2 = 2.6 C.\n\n   So, after their separation, Spheres B and C each have a charge of 2.6 C.\n\nTherefore, the final charge on Sphere C is 2.6 C.",
