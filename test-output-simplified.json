However, it is not currently believed that a situation like that depicted in the Terminator films is a realistic possibility.\n\nIt is important for society to continue to monitor and address the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with artificial intelligence, and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a responsible and safe manner.",
