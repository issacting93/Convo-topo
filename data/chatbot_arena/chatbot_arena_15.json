      "content": "She felt something and likes me but loves other man. She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It sounds like you and the person you are talking to have a healthy and consensual relationship, and you both want to continue it. Blocking and cutting off communication with the other person is not a healthy or constructive way to handle a situation, and can lead to hurt feelings and a breakdown in trust. Instead of resorting to these drastic measures, I recommend having an honest conversation with the person you are angry with and trying to understand why you feel the way you do. It may also be helpful to seek support from a therapist or trusted friend, as you are both dealing with feelings and behaviors that may be challenging to overcome."

      "content": "It really depends on the situation and the people involved. If you are feeling angry and hurt by the other person's actions, it may be helpful to have an honest conversation with them over a longer period of time. However, if you feel that cutting off communication is the best way to resolve the situation, then you may want to consider seeking help sooner rather than later. It can be really helpful to process and practice forgiveness, especially when it involves hurting someone's feelings. This can help you learn to move on from the situation and find healthier ways of coping with emotions."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It can be helpful to think about what you are gaining by cutting off communication. You are gaining the ability to move on from the situation without having to deal with the emotional hurt and pain of the other person. Self-respect and emotional healing can also be connected to moving on from a situation in a healthy way. It can be really helpful to think of yourself as a strong and capable person who is taking care of themselves and moving on from the situation."

      "content": "It can be helpful to prioritize self-respect over the idea of a great relationship. You want to focus on being a good person and treating others with kindness and respect, rather than getting caught up in a romantic or emotional connection with someone else. This can help you move on from the situation with the other person and find a healthier way of coping with your emotions. It can also be helpful to focus on your own emotional well-being and healing, rather than getting caught up in a romantic or emotional connection with someone else. This can help you move on from the situation with the other person in a healthy way."

This can help you move on from the situation in a healthy way and find a healthier way of coping with your emotions. If you are able to approach the situation with a clear mind, you may be able to have a constructive conversation with the other person about the situation and how you are feeling. If you are not able to approach the situation with a clear mind, you may want to consider seeking support from a therapist or trusted friend, as you are both dealing with feelings and behaviors that may be challenging to overcome."
