As as a rough estimation, it's believed that people drink approximately 3 cups of tea daily.\n\nIf you have recently increased your tea intake to five to seven cups per day and are experiencing symptoms such as nausea and bloating, it is advisable to see a doctor for guidance. Excessive tea consumption can lead to side effects such as dehydration, nausea, and bloating."

At the other end of the scale Mexicans don't even know what a teapot looks like, and almost everyone south of them prefers coffee.\n\nThe preference for tea is both cultural and historical. Countries that had empires in or are linked to Asia generally prefer tea, and to South America tend to prefer coffee. US cultural domination has had quite an effect too, media influence has seen gradual shift from tea towards coffee."

Either way, what matters more than the average is your specific body's reaction to it. If you think the nausea is related to drinking more tea, try reducing your intake and see if it helps. If it continues and you don't know why, you should go see a doctor."

      "content": "Too much caffeine can cause stomach issues, which can result in you feeling nauseous and bloated. Five to seven cups would lead to a higher caffeine intake than most people. As caffeine is an addictive substance, most people will naturally take as much of it as they can until they feel uncomfortable taking more, suggesting that on average higher amounts are more likely to cause discomfort. However a proper probability cannot be given until you take into account all the other things that have changed from when you did not feel nauseous and bloated. Once you have identified all the changes that have occurred that can lead to you feeling unwell, you will be able to assign a probability to the caffeine. Alternatively, you can experiment with taking your previous level of caffeine. If your symptoms decline, it is highly likely the caffeine was the problem. Ultimately, through experimentation by stopping activities you have recently changed to the activities which you did previously, you should be able to find the cause of your discomfort."
