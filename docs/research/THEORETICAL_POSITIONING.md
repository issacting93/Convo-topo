# Theoretical Positioning: Beyond Dyadic Human-System Relations

## How Conversational Topography Re-examines Interactivity

This document articulates how Conversational Topography addresses the call to move beyond dyadic human-system relations toward distributed, entangled, and systemic understandings of interactive systems.

---

## 1. Questioning Underlying Assumptions

### 1.1 Challenging the Dyadic Model

**Traditional Assumption**: Human-AI interaction is a simple dyad—one human, one system, exchanging messages.

**This Project's Challenge**: 
- Treats conversation as **entangled roles, conventions, and accumulated practices** rather than isolated exchanges
- Reveals how **relational configurations accumulate** over time, creating patterns that extend beyond individual interactions
- Shows how **authority, agency, and control are distributed** through interactional positioning, not fixed in the human or the AI

**Evidence in the System**:
- Role distributions (probabilistic, mixed) rather than fixed labels
- Temporal patterns showing how relational configurations "sediment" over time
- Multiple analytic lenses revealing how assumptions shape interpretation

### 1.2 Reframing Interactivity

**Traditional View**: Interactivity = user input → system response → user input...

**This Project's Reframing**:
- Interactivity as **relational positioning** that unfolds across turns
- Interactional configurations as **observable structure** rather than inferred psychology
- Conversation as **social action** embedded in broader sociotechnical systems

## 2. Design Inquiry

### 2.1 Visualization as Inquiry, Not Optimization

The system is explicitly **not** a diagnostic tool or optimization interface. Instead:

- **Exploratory**: Invites play and discovery rather than task completion
- **Reflective**: Surfaces ambiguity and interpretive tension
- **Critical**: Makes visible the assumptions and consequences of representation

**Key Design Choices**:
- Probabilistic role distributions (60% seeker, 40% director) rather than categorical labels
- PAD-based Z-axis (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) making emotional intensity directly visible
- Alternative readings surfaced in HUD rather than single "correct" interpretation
- Confidence scores and evidence quotes displayed prominently to emphasize interpretive status

### 2.2 Staging Encounters with Invisible Patterns

The terrain metaphor makes visible patterns that typically remain invisible:
- **Relational drift**: How positioning changes over time (X/Y axes show functional↔social and structured↔emergent shifts)
- **Affective patterns**: How emotional friction (peaks) and affiliation (valleys) correspond to interactional moments (Z-axis via PAD)
- **Distribution**: How authority and agency are distributed, not fixed (role distributions, positioning)

**Methodological Contribution**: Offers a way of **staging encounters** with relational ecosystems, inviting reflection on what should—and should not—be made legible.

---

## 3. Politics

### 3.1 Making Power Visible

The visualization reveals **political dimensions** often hidden in technical systems:

**Power Distribution**:
- **X-axis (Functional ↔ Social)**: Reveals who sets agendas, who follows scripts
- **Y-axis (Structured ↔ Emergent)**: Shows how control is negotiated or prescribed
- **Role distributions**: Exposes how authority is delegated, challenged, or shared

**Political Questions Made Visible**:
- Who has authority to set the agenda?
- How is agency distributed between human and AI?
- What patterns of dependence or delegation emerge?
- How do interactional habits become infrastructure?

### 3.2 The Politics of Representation

The system explicitly engages with **the politics of representation**:

- **What gets visualized**: Relational dynamics, not sentiment or topic structure
- **How it's visualized**: Spatial encodings that reveal distribution and accumulation
- **What remains ambiguous**: Uncertainty as a first-class dimension, not hidden or smoothed over

**Critical Stance**: The system doesn't claim to show "truth" but stages encounters with **interpretive choice**—making visible how visualization decisions shape meaning.

---

## 4. Aesthetics

### 4.1 Aesthetic Choices as Epistemic Decisions

The terrain metaphor is an **aesthetic choice** that shapes what becomes legible:

**Spatial Aesthetics**:
- **Paths and trajectories**: Conversation as movement through space
- **Elevation and contours**: Metrics as topography, not numbers
- **Ridges and basins**: Patterns as landscape features

**Aesthetic Effects**:
- Makes accumulation and persistence **visually tangible**
- Invites **spatial reasoning** about relational dynamics
- Creates **affective engagement** through navigation and exploration

### 4.2 Aesthetics of Interpretation

The system treats interpretation **aesthetically**:
- Probabilistic role distributions → shown as percentages (not forced categories)
- Confidence scores → displayed prominently (not hidden or smoothed)
- Alternative readings → surfaced in HUD (not dismissed)
- PAD emotional intensity → encoded directly as Z-height (peaks = frustration, valleys = affiliation)

This aesthetic approach makes the interpretive status of the visualization **visible and navigable** rather than treating it as objective truth. The terrain metaphor itself foregrounds that this is a representation, not a literal model.

---

## 5. Ethics

### 5.1 What Should Be Legible?

The system provokes **ethical questions** about legibility:

**Questions Raised**:
- Should relational dynamics be visualized at all?
- What are the risks of making the invisible visible?
- How should uncertainty be staged?
- What patterns become visible that weren't apparent in linear transcripts?

**Ethical Stance**:
- **Non-diagnostic**: Doesn't judge users or infer private intent
- **Non-personifying**: Doesn't treat AI as having psychology
- **Interpretive**: Offers surface for reflection, not conclusions
- **Collective**: Designed for discussion and critique, not individual assessment

### 5.2 Ethical Craftsmanship

The system demonstrates **ethical craftsmanship** through:

- **Transparency**: Shows confidence scores, alternatives, evidence quotes
- **Ambiguity**: Preserves uncertainty rather than resolving it
- **Reflexivity**: Makes visible its own assumptions and limitations
- **Privacy**: No storage by default, explicit consent for user data

---

## 6. Craftsmanship

### 6.1 Technical Craftsmanship

The system demonstrates craftsmanship through:

**Precision**:
- Stable coordinate frame (X/Y relational positioning consistent across all visualizations)
- Z-axis directly encodes PAD emotional intensity (moment-to-moment, not accumulation)
- Evidence-based classification with quotes and rationales
- Probabilistic role distributions (not forced categories)

**Care**:
- Multiple fallback systems for edge cases (missing PAD data, missing classifications)
- PAD scores calculated per message with hybrid approach (conversation-level base + message-level adjustments)
- Alternative readings surfaced, not hidden
- Confidence scores and evidence quotes displayed prominently

**Attention to Detail**:
- Role distributions sum to 1.0 (validated)
- Confidence calibration (0.3-1.0 scale)
- Evidence quotes required for all classifications

### 6.2 Craftsmanship as Inquiry

The craftsmanship serves **inquiry** rather than optimization:

- **Interpretive surface**: Crafted to invite reflection, not provide answers
- **PAD-based encoding**: Crafted to make emotional friction and affiliation visible as terrain features
- **Probabilistic display**: Crafted to emphasize interpretation rather than certainty
- **Evidence and confidence**: Crafted to make classification assumptions transparent and contestable

## 7. Distributed, Entangled, Systemic Understandings

### 7.1 Distributed Relations

The system reveals how relations are **distributed**:

**Not Just Human ↔ AI**:
- **Social relations**: How people learn to interact with computational systems
- **Cultural relations**: How communication norms are encoded in technical systems
- **Temporal relations**: How relational configurations accumulate over time

**Distribution Through Positioning**:
- Authority distributed through interactional positioning
- Agency distributed through role negotiation
- Control distributed through scripted vs. emergent patterns

### 7.2 Entangled Systems

The system treats conversation as **entangled**:

**Entanglements Revealed**:
- **Sociotechnical**: How technical affordances shape interactional possibilities
- **Cultural**: How communication norms and power dynamics are encoded
- **Temporal**: How relational configurations accumulate and transform

**Recursive Relations**:
- AI systems analyzing AI-mediated interactions (Claude API analyzing conversations)
- The classifier itself becomes part of what the visualization makes visible
- PAD scores derived from LLM-based analysis of conversation content and structure
- The recursive nature (AI analyzing AI interactions) becomes a feature to reflect upon, not a bug to hide

### 7.3 Systemic Patterns

The system reveals **systemic patterns**:

**Beyond Individual Interactions**:
- How relational configurations "sediment" over time
- How interactional habits become infrastructure
- How patterns persist across conversations

**Systemic Impacts**:
- **Social Domain**: How conversational AI mediates social relations
- **Cultural Domain**: How cultural assumptions are embedded and reproduced
- **Political Domain**: How power is distributed through positioning
- **Temporal Domain**: How lasting patterns extend beyond individual exchanges
