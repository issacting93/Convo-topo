## Quick Navigation

### 🎯 For DIS 2026 Submission
- **[DIS2026 Interactivity Submission (Final)](DIS2026_Interactivity_Submission_FINAL.md)** - Main conference submission paper (final version)
- **[DIS Submission](../DIS_SUBMISSION.md)** - Alternative submission version with additional features
- **[DIS2026 Technical Specs](DIS2026_Technical_Specs.md)** - Technical specifications and requirements
- **[User Experience and Interaction](USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_INTERACTION.md)** - Complete user engagement flow documentation

### 📚 Theoretical Framework

**Comprehensive Analysis:**
- **[Critical Computing and Design Theory](CRITICAL_COMPUTING_AND_DESIGN_THEORY.md)** - Detailed analysis with code examples showing how the system engages with critical computing principles
  - Sections: Questioning assumptions, Design inquiry, Politics, Aesthetics, Ethics, Craftsmanship
  - Includes: Code snippets demonstrating implementation of theoretical principles
  - Length: ~930 lines

**Concise Positioning:**
- **[Theoretical Positioning](THEORETICAL_POSITIONING.md)** - Concise articulation of how the system moves beyond dyadic relations
  - Focus: Key theoretical contributions in brief format
  - Sections: Questioning assumptions, Design inquiry, Politics, Aesthetics, Ethics, Distributed relations
  - Length: ~280 lines

**Note**: Both documents cover similar theoretical ground. Use CRITICAL_COMPUTING_AND_DESIGN_THEORY.md for comprehensive analysis with implementation details. Use THEORETICAL_POSITIONING.md for concise summaries.

### 👥 User Experience

- **[User Experience and Interaction](USER_EXPERIENCE_AND_INTERACTION.md)** - Complete documentation of user engagement
  - Current implementation details
  - Envisioned DIS installation experience
  - Complete encounter arc (approach → engage → reflect → depart)
  - Navigation controls and interaction specifications
  - Code examples throughout
  - Length: ~557 lines

### 📋 Classification and Taxonomy

- **[Taxonomy](../TAXONOMY.md)** - Complete classification taxonomy (9 dimensions)
- **[Role Metadata](../ROLE_METADATA.md)** - Role definitions and metadata
- **[Sociolinguistic Terms](../SOCIOLINGUISTIC_TERMS.md)** - Term definitions

### 📄 Conference Submissions

- **[DIS2026 Interactivity Submission (Final)](DIS2026_Interactivity_Submission_FINAL.md)** - Final version matching current implementation
- **[DIS2026 Interactivity Submission (Revised)](DIS2026_Interactivity_Submission_Revised.md)** - **Use this version** - Revised based on feedback
- **[DIS2026 Interactivity Submission (.tex)](DIS2026_Interactivity_Submission.tex)** - LaTeX version
- **[DIS](DIS.md)** - DIS conference notes

## Key Concepts Across Documents

### Coordinate System
- **X-axis**: Functional ↔ Social (user positioning)
- **Y-axis**: Structured ↔ Emergent (AI positioning)  
- **Z-axis**: Terrain height (currently composite mode)

### Design Principles
- Exploratory, not prescriptive
- Reflective, not diagnostic
- Probabilistic, not categorical
- Transparent, not black-box

### Theoretical Contributions
- Beyond dyadic human-system relations
- Distributed, entangled, systemic understandings
- Observable structure rather than inferred psychology
- Design as inquiry, not optimization
