## Abstract (150 words)

**Version: Final (147 words) - Verified and Accurate**

We present "Conversational Cartography," a visual framework that maps human-AI interaction as movement through relational-affective space. Analysis of 562 validated conversations reveals a core insight: interactions with identical role classifications often take dramatically different affective journeys, with variance ratios up to 82x between calm information-seeking and volatile adversarial testing. By mapping conversations onto 3D terrain (functional/social, aligned/divergent, emotional intensity via PAD model), we expose these invisible dynamics—demonstrating that 83.3% of clustering variance is driven by trajectory features rather than static labels. Using spatial metaphors, we visualize how authority and emotion distribute over time, making visible patterns like relational drift and frustration peaks that aggregate metrics obscure. The visualization reveals that same-labeled conversations (e.g., "information-seeker → expert-system") can range from flat detached browsing (variance 0.0004) to volatile adversarial testing (variance 0.0164, 41x higher). This work contributes to C&C's theme of *Creativity and Change* by proposing a new form of knowledge: treating conversation not as a log to be read, but as a terrain to be traversed, revealing the hidden emotional labor and power dynamics of human-AI relations.

  - **WildChat:** 185 conversations (organic usage)
- **Validation:** Schema validation, classification completeness, role distribution validity
- **Data Quality:** 97.7% classification success rate (337/345 with all dimensions)

### Classification
- **Model:** OpenAI GPT-5.2 (Social Role Theory taxonomy)
- **Taxonomy:** 12 roles (6 human + 6 AI) based on Social Role Theory
  - **Human:** information-seeker, provider, director, collaborator, social-expressor, relational-peer
  - **AI:** expert-system, advisor, learning-facilitator, co-constructor, social-facilitator, relational-peer
- **Dimensions:** 9-dimensional analysis (interaction pattern, power dynamics, emotional tone, engagement style, knowledge exchange, conversation purpose, turn taking, human roles, AI roles)
- **Validation:** Manual review of 20 conversations (66.7% agreement with GPT-5.2, 12/18 conversations)
- **Confidence:** Average confidence 0.743 (moderate-high)

### Spatial Encoding
- **X-Axis (Communication Function):** Functional (0.0) ↔ Social (1.0)
  - Hybrid calculation: linguistic analysis + role-based metadata
- **Y-Axis (Conversation Structure):** Aligned (0.0) ↔ Divergent (1.0)
  - Primary: linguistic alignment; fallback: pattern-based mapping
- **Z-Axis (Emotional Intensity):** PAD model
  - Formula: `EI = (1 - Pleasure) × 0.6 + Arousal × 0.4`
  - Range: 0.0 (calm/affiliation) to 1.0 (frustration/agitation)

### Path Generation
- **Starting Point:** All conversations begin at center (0.5, 0.5)
- **Target Position:** Determined by conversation-level classifications
- **Drift Calculation:** Per-message variation based on linguistic features
  - Base drift toward target + message-level variation
  - Temporal progression with accelerated middle
  - Normalization scaled by conversation length

### Clustering Analysis
- **Method:** K-means clustering (7 clusters, validated with hierarchical clustering)
- **Features:** 45 features (trajectory + classification)
- **Key Finding:** 82.7% of cluster separation from trajectory features (spatial drift, path straightness, emotional intensity patterns)
- **Separation:** Silhouette score 0.160 (weak separation, continuous variation interpreted as archetypal tendencies)

### Visualization
- **Technology:** React + TypeScript, Three.js (WebGL)
- **Modes:** Terrain view, grid view, spatial clustering, role dashboard, comparison view, PAD timeline, relational drift

## Success Criteria

✓ Visuals are primary - text supports, doesn't dominate  
✓ Each page is visually engaging and informative  
✓ Contribution is clear from visuals alone  
✓ Format requirements met (12 pages, landscape, accessible)  
✓ Professional quality throughout  
✓ Aligns with "Creativity and Change" theme

## Notes

- Remember: This is a VISUAL format - celebrate the images
- Don't force text where visuals can communicate
- Annotations and captions can carry substantial meaning
- Quality over quantity - fewer, better visuals > many mediocre ones
- Test with others: Can they understand the contribution from visuals alone?
