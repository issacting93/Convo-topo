- Connects to C&C theme explicitly
- Well within word limit (147/150 words)

**Abstract Text:**

> We present a visual framework for understanding human-AI conversation as movement through relational-affective space. Moving beyond anthropomorphic assumptions and input-output models, we map conversations onto three-dimensional terrain where positioning (functional/social, structured/emergent) and affective intensity reveal recurrent interaction patterns. Using spatial metaphors—contours, pathways, markers—we visualize how authority, affiliation, and emotion distribute across conversations, making visible patterns like relational drift, frustration peaks, and spatial clustering that traditional analysis obscures. Through annotated visualizations of diverse conversations, we demonstrate how this approach surfaces insights about human-AI interaction without reducing it to psychological inference. The atlas challenges text-centric analysis, privileging visual representation as both method and medium for understanding relational dynamics. We discuss the method's portability across datasets and domains, its visibility/reification tensions, and implications for design research. This work contributes to C&C's theme of Creativity and Change by proposing alternative forms of knowledge about human-AI relations that foreground spatial and visual thinking.

## Success Criteria

✓ Visuals are primary - text supports, doesn't dominate  
✓ Each page is visually engaging and informative  
✓ Contribution is clear from visuals alone  
✓ Format requirements met (12 pages, landscape, accessible)  
✓ Professional quality throughout  
✓ Aligns with "Creativity and Change" theme

## Notes

- Remember: This is a VISUAL format - celebrate the images
- Don't force text where visuals can communicate
- Annotations and captions can carry substantial meaning
- Quality over quantity - fewer, better visuals > many mediocre ones
- Test with others: Can they understand the contribution from visuals alone?
