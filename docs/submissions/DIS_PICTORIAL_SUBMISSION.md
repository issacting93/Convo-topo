**Title (Anonymous)**
*Conversation Cartographer: Mapping Relational Trajectories in Human–AI Dialogue*

**Abstract (≤150 words)**
Human–AI conversations are traditionally analyzed as text transcripts or metrics, obscuring relational dynamics that unfold over time. We introduce *Conversation Cartographer*, a visual system that renders dialogue as trajectories through a three-dimensional relational space defined by functional–social orientation, linguistic alignment, and affective intensity. By encoding each turn as a coordinate and constructing continuous paths, the map reveals patterns of relational drift, emotional change, and role positioning that are invisible in surface statistics. Analysis of 345 validated conversations shows that trajectory features account for the vast majority of pattern separation, and that conversations with the same dominant social role can follow dramatically different paths. The visual terrain and clustered landscapes enable designers and researchers to see, compare, and interpret conversational journeys, supporting more transparent and role-aware interactive systems. Substantive visuals are central to conveying these design insights.

## ⧉ Pictorial Narrative Text

### 1. Motivation

Traditional dialogue analysis treats exchanges as isolated text or point snapshots, masking relational dynamics important for trust, role interpretations, and system behavior. Our visual artifact shifts the unit of analysis to **trajectory and terrain**, making the *path* of interaction visible.

> **[FIGURE 1: Terrain Overview vs. Transcript]**
> *Visual Suggestion: A side-by-side comparison. Left: A standard JSON log or flat chat transcript snippet (opaque). Right: The same conversation rendered as a rich 3D terrain path (revealing).*
> *Caption: Transforming linear text logs into spatial navigational trajectories.*

### 2. Spatial Encoding Model

We define a relational space with three dimensions:

*   **Functional ↔ Social Orientation (X)** — captures the spectrum from task-oriented to socially oriented exchanges.
*   **Linguistic Alignment (Y)** — measures structural and stylistic convergence between interlocutors.
*   **Affective Intensity (Z)** — encodes emotional prominence using a PAD-derived height metric.

> *Caption: The three-dimensional relational space encodes functional orientation, linguistic alignment, and emotional intensity.*

### 3. Conversation Trajectories

Each message becomes a coordinate; sequences form continuous paths — *conversational journeys*. These journeys reveal not only endpoints but the evolving relational shape of interaction.

> **[FIGURE 3: Trajectory Construction]**
> *Visual Suggestion: A step-by-step visual build: (A) Single message point -> (B) Two points connected -> (C) Full continuous path with drift and velocity cues.*
> *Caption: Constructing the journey: individual turns are connected to visualize drift and relational velocity.*

### 4. Patterns & Landscapes

Clustering trajectories exposes distinct relational landscapes and emergent regions of the terrain. Importantly, quantitative analysis confirms that **trajectory features dominate pattern separation**, validating the visual system as a lens into coherent interaction structures.

> **[FIGURE 4: Clustered Landscapes]**
> *Visual Suggestion: High-level map showing color-coded clusters (e.g., "Affiliation Valley", "Frustration Peak"). Heatmap style overlay distinct regions.*
> *Caption: Emergent landscapes: Clustering reveals distinct interaction regions defined by movement patterns rather than just semantic topics.*

### 5. Same Roles, Different Journeys

Visual comparison of multiple conversations with identical dominant roles shows striking differences in trajectory shape and emotional contour, illustrating that role labels alone are insufficient without path context.

> **[FIGURE 5: Comparative Pairs]**
> *Visual Suggestion: Two terrain panels side-by-side. Both tagged as "Info-Seeking", but one is a smooth flat line (efficient) and the other is a jagged high-peak path (frustrated).*
> *Caption: Taxonomy vs. Topography: Two conversations with identical "Information Seeking" role labels exhibit drastically different relational journeys.*

### 6. Design Implications

Making relational journeys visible suggests new opportunities for interaction design:

*   supporting **role continuity** across model switches
*   exposing **trajectory cues** to users
*   guiding systems to respect relational expectations
*   preventing abrupt “relational fractures” in conversation

> **[FIGURE 6: Design Intervention Schematics]**
> *Visual Suggestion: Schematic sketches or "HUD" mockups showing how a user might see their "current drift" or "relational coordinate" in real-time.*
> *Caption: Design interventions: Visualizing trajectory cues to support role continuity and prevent relational fractures.*

### 7. Scaffolding and Reflection

The narrative complements visuals and emphasizes generative questions rather than definitive claims. It positions *Conversational Cartography* as both a **design artifact** and an **analytical lens** for rethinking dialogue, trust, and interaction patterns beyond text. Supporting panels situate this work within design research through visual examples, sketches, and reflective notes.
