## Your Refined Abstract

What relational possibilities are foreclosed when human–AI interaction collapses into instrumental tool-use? Conversational Cartography maps 345 conversations as movement through relational-affective space, encoding social role orientation, structural alignment, and emotional intensity. Using a 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy, we reveal that interactions with identical role pairings take dramatically different trajectories (82x variance), yet clustering identifies only 7 relational positioning patterns—72% functional/structured, expressive human roles nearly absent (<3%). Current paradigms systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange. The visualization externalizes this constraint as navigable terrain: most conversations cluster in narrow functional corridors, revealing what's missing rather than what exists. By using GPT-5.2 to classify AI-mediated interactions, we create methodological circularity exposing how AI systems interpret their own relational possibilities. The visualization is not diagnostic but critical—a tool for confronting what current interaction paradigms foreclose.

## Strengths of This Version

### ✅ Excellent Improvements

1. **Tighter, more powerful** - 133 words vs 150 (17 words saved for flexibility)
2. **Better flow** - More concise phrasing without losing meaning
3. **Stronger ending** - "a tool for confronting what current interaction paradigms foreclose" creates perfect circularity back to opening question
4. **Direct statement** - "Current paradigms systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange" (standalone sentence, very clear)
5. **"Relational possibilities"** - Nice framing: "interpret their own relational possibilities" (broader than "constrain relational imagination")

### ✅ All Key Claims Verified

- ✅ 345 conversations
- ✅ 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy
- ✅ 82x variance
- ✅ 7 patterns, 72% functional/structured
- ✅ <3% expressive roles
- ✅ GPT-5.2, methodological circularity
- ✅ Foreclosure focus throughout
- ✅ Critical framing ("not diagnostic but critical")

## Potential Considerations

### 1. Missing "Challenges Dyadic Models" Explicitly

**Your version:** Implicit but not explicit  
**Previous version:** "The visualization challenges dyadic models"

**Question:** Is explicit mention needed for DIS Critical Computing track?  
**Recommendation:** Probably fine - the foreclosure framing inherently challenges dyadic models. But if you want to be explicit, you have 17 words of room.

**Optional addition (if desired):**
- Add: "challenging dyadic models of human-system relations" somewhere
- Would bring to ~140 words, still well under limit

### 2. "Interpret their own relational possibilities" vs "Constrain relational imagination"

**Your version:** "exposing how AI systems interpret their own relational possibilities"  
**Previous:** "constraining relational imagination"

**Both are valid, but slightly different:**
- **Your version:** More neutral - AI is interpreting/seeing possibilities
- **Previous:** More critical - AI is constraining/imiting imagination

**Your version is good** - the foreclosure is already established, so "interpret their own relational possibilities" works well as the circularity insight.

### 3. Missing "Political Dimensions" Explicitly

**Your version:** Implicit in "foreclose" and "critical"  
**Previous:** "political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned"

**Question:** Needed for Critical Computing track?  
**Recommendation:** Probably fine - "foreclose" and "systematically reduce" are inherently political. But if you want to be explicit, you have room.

## Alignment with DIS 2026 Themes

✅ **Challenges dyadic model** - Implicit in foreclosure framing  
✅ **Attends to complex networks** - "paradigms systematically reduce," "current interaction paradigms"  
✅ **Critical examination** - "foreclose," "what's missing," "not diagnostic but critical"  
✅ **Makes visible layered dimensions** - "narrow functional corridors," "revealing what's missing"  
✅ **Political, ethical, societal** - "foreclose," "systematically reduce," "confronting what paradigms foreclose"

---

## Recommendation

**Use this version as-is.** It's excellent. The 133 words give you flexibility if reviewers want more detail, but it's already:

- ✅ Powerful and concise
- ✅ All claims verified
- ✅ Perfect circularity (opening question → ending confrontation)
- ✅ Strong critical framing
- ✅ Well-aligned with DIS themes

**Optional Enhancements** (if you want to be more explicit):
- Add "challenging dyadic models" somewhere (adds ~5 words)
- Add "political" explicitly (adds ~1 word)
- But honestly, your version is strong as-is.

## Final Check

**Word Count:** 133/150 ✅  
**Key Claims:** All verified ✅  
**Critical Framing:** Strong ✅  
**Circularity:** Excellent (question → confrontation) ✅  
**DIS Alignment:** Strong ✅

**Status:** Ready for submission!
