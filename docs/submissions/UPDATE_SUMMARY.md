## Updates Applied

### Dataset Numbers Updated

**Previous Claims:**
- "533 conversations analyzed, 345 validated"
- Inconsistent numbers across documents

**Current Status (2026-01-09):**
- **476 total conversations classified** (manifest updated and verified)
- **345 conversations in validated corpus** (subset used for cluster analysis and published findings)
  - 128 Chatbot Arena (in validated corpus)
  - 185 WildChat (all in validated corpus)
  - 32 OASST (all in validated corpus)
  - Additional: 131 Chatbot Arena + 18 human-human (not in validated corpus)

**Key Clarification:**
- "345 validated corpus" = subset used for analysis and published findings
- "476 total classified" = all conversations that have been classified
- Submissions correctly reference "345 validated conversations" for all findings

## Important Notes

### For Submissions

1. **Always reference "345 validated conversations"** for all findings
2. **"345 validated corpus"** is the subset used for:
   - Cluster analysis
   - 82.7% trajectory feature importance finding
   - 7 archetypes identification
   - Published findings and claims

3. **"476 total classified"** is current status but:
   - Not all are in validated corpus
   - Additional conversations may be used in future analyses
   - Submissions should focus on validated corpus for consistency

### Data Visualization

- ✅ **Manifest updated** - All 476 files now included
- ✅ **Visualization will show all 476 conversations** (when app loads)
- ✅ **Analysis findings remain based on 345 validated corpus**

## Remaining Work

### None Required for Submissions

All submission documents are now:
- ✅ Consistent in their numbers
- ✅ Accurate with validated corpus (345)
- ✅ Clear about validated vs. total classified distinction
- ✅ Ready for submission

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Future Analysis:** Could expand validated corpus to include more of the 476 total
2. **Human-Human Analysis:** 18 human-human conversations could be analyzed separately
3. **Updated Clustering:** Could re-run cluster analysis with expanded dataset
