## Abstract (150 words) ✅

What relational possibilities are foreclosed when human–AI interaction collapses into instrumental tool-use? **Conversational Cartography** maps 345 validated conversations as movement through relational-affective space, encoding social role orientation, structural alignment, and emotional intensity. Using a 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy reveals that interactions with identical role pairings take dramatically different trajectories (82x variance), yet clustering identifies only 7 relational positioning patterns—trajectory features drive 82.7% of cluster separation—72% functional/structured, expressive human roles nearly absent (<3%). Current paradigms systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange. The visualization externalizes this constraint as navigable terrain: most cluster in narrow functional corridors revealing what's missing. Using GPT-5.2 to classify AI-mediated interactions creates methodological circularity, exposing how AI systems interpret their own relational possibilities. It challenges dyadic models of human-system relations, staging encounters with political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned—in relationships. It is not diagnostic but critical—a tool for confronting what current interaction paradigms foreclose.

## Word Count Verification

**Count:** 150 words ✅

**Key Elements:**
- ✅ Opens with critical question about foreclosure
- ✅ 345 conversations (validated corpus), 12-role taxonomy
- ✅ 82x variance ratio, **82.7% trajectory features** (added)
- ✅ 7 patterns, 72% functional/structured
- ✅ <3% expressive roles (corrected)
- ✅ Foregrounds what's missing/foreclosed
- ✅ Methodological circularity as critical insight
- ✅ **Challenges dyadic models explicitly** (added)
- ✅ Political dimensions explicitly mentioned
- ✅ Perfect circularity (question → confrontation)

**Dataset Status (2026-01-10):**
- ✅ **345 conversations** = validated corpus (subset of larger dataset)
  - Used for cluster analysis and published findings
  - All statistics (82.7%, 7 clusters, variance ratios) based on this subset
- ✅ **Current expanded dataset**: 569 total conversations, 538 with new taxonomy (94.6%)
  - The 345 validated corpus is part of this larger dataset
  - Additional conversations classified but not yet in validated corpus

## Key Trims Made

1. **"we reveal that"** → **"reveals that"** (saves 2 words)
2. **"most conversations cluster"** → **"most cluster"** (saves 1 word)
3. **"revealing what's missing rather than what exists"** → **"revealing what's missing"** (saves 4 words)
4. **"By using...we create"** → **"Using...creates"** (saves 2 words)
5. **"The visualization"** → **"It"** (removes repetition, saves 2 words)
6. **"in designed relationships"** → **"in relationships"** (saves 1 word)

**Total saved:** 12 words (to accommodate both additions: 82.7% trajectory + dyadic challenge)

## Alignment with DIS 2026 Critical Computing Track

✅ **Challenges dyadic model** - "challenges dyadic models of human-system relations" (explicit)  
✅ **Attends to complex networks** - "paradigms systematically reduce," "current interaction paradigms"  
✅ **Critical examination** - "foreclose," "what's missing," "not diagnostic but critical"  
✅ **Makes visible layered dimensions** - "political dimensions," "narrow functional corridors"  
✅ **Political, ethical, societal** - "foreclose," "systematically reduce," "confronting what paradigms foreclose"

## Recommendation

**Use this version** - It incorporates both enhancements (82.7% trajectory features and explicit dyadic challenge) while maintaining your excellent structure and flow. The explicit mentions strengthen alignment with DIS 2026 Critical Computing track.
