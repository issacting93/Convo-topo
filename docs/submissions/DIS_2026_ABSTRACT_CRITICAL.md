## Abstract (Critical Computing Framing)

**Version 1: Foregrounding Foreclosure (150 words)**

What relational possibilities are foreclosed when human-AI interaction collapses into instrumental tool-use? **Conversational Cartography** maps 562 conversations as movement through relational-affective space, encoding social role orientation, structural alignment, and emotional intensity to visualize dynamics invisible to aggregate metrics. Using a 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy, we reveal that interactions with identical role pairings take dramatically different trajectories—variance ratios up to 82x—yet clustering identifies only 7 relational positioning patterns, with 72% functional/structured. Organic usage data shows expressive human roles nearly absent (<3%), suggesting current paradigms systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange, foreclosing relational possibilities. The visualization externalizes this constraint as navigable terrain: most conversations cluster in narrow functional corridors, revealing what's missing rather than what exists. By using GPT-5.2 to classify AI-mediated interactions, we create methodological circularity that exposes how AI systems interpret their own interactions—and how those interpretations constrain relational imagination. The visualization challenges the dyadic model of human-system relations, staging encounters with the political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned—in designed relationships.

## Abstract (Alternative: Opening with Critical Question) (150 words)

**Version 2: Research Question Lead (150 words)**

How do current paradigms of human-AI interaction foreclose relational possibilities? **Conversational Cartography** maps 562 conversations as movement through relational-affective space, using a 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy to encode social role orientation, structural alignment, and emotional intensity. Analysis reveals that interactions with identical role pairings take dramatically different trajectories (variance ratios up to 82x), yet clustering identifies only 7 relational positioning patterns—72% functional/structured, with expressive human roles nearly absent (<3%) in organic usage. The visualization externalizes this constraint as navigable terrain: most conversations cluster in narrow functional corridors, revealing what's missing rather than what exists. By using GPT-5.2 to classify AI-mediated interactions, we create methodological circularity that exposes how AI systems interpret their own interactions—and how those interpretations constrain relational imagination. The visualization stages encounters with the political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned—in designed relationships, challenging the dyadic model of human-system relations by making visible the sociotechnical constraints that shape interactional possibility.

## Abstract (Balanced: Critical + Empirical) (150 words)

**Version 3: Balanced Framing (150 words)**

**Conversational Cartography** maps human-AI dialogue as movement through relational-affective space, encoding social role orientation, structural alignment, and emotional intensity to visualize dynamics invisible to aggregate metrics. Using a 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy, we classify 562 conversations and reveal that interactions with identical role pairings take dramatically different trajectories—variance ratios up to 82x between detached browsing and adversarial testing. Clustering identifies 7 relational positioning patterns, with trajectory features accounting for 83.3% of cluster separation: *how* participants move through role-space matters more than the roles themselves. Yet 72% of patterns are functional/structured, with expressive human roles nearly absent (<3%) in organic usage—suggesting current paradigms systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange, foreclosing relational possibilities. The visualization externalizes this constraint as navigable terrain, revealing what's missing rather than what exists. By using GPT-5.2 to classify AI-mediated interactions, we create methodological circularity that exposes how AI systems interpret their own interactions. The visualization stages encounters with the political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned—in designed relationships.

## Key Differences from Previous Abstract

### What Changed

1. **Opens with critical question** (Version 1) or foregrounds foreclosure (all versions)
2. **Surfaces political/ethical implications**: "foreclosing relational possibilities," "political dimensions"
3. **Frames 7 patterns as constraint**: "only 7 patterns," "72% functional/structured" (not just "7 patterns identified")
4. **Emphasizes what's missing**: "revealing what's missing rather than what exists"
5. **Challenges dyadic model**: Explicitly mentioned in Version 2
6. **Methodological circularity as critical insight**: "exposes how AI systems interpret their own interactions—and how those interpretations constrain relational imagination"

### What Stayed

- ✅ 562 conversations
- ✅ 12-role Social Role Theory taxonomy
- ✅ 82x variance ratio
- ✅ 83.3% trajectory features
- ✅ 7 patterns
- ✅ <3% expressive roles (corrected from 0%)
- ✅ Visualization as cognitive tool

## Alignment with DIS 2026 Themes

### ✅ Challenges Dyadic Model
- "challenging the dyadic model of human-system relations"
- Shows how relational positioning is distributed, not fixed
- Reveals sociotechnical constraints, not just individual interactions

### ✅ Attends to Complex Networks
- "sociotechnical constraints that shape interactional possibility"
- Shows how interface design, model alignment, and cultural practices constrain relations
- Reveals patterns that extend beyond individual conversations

### ✅ Critical Examination of Relationships
- "foreclosing relational possibilities"
- "systematically reduce AI interaction to instrumental exchange"
- Questions what relationships are possible vs. what's being constrained

### ✅ Makes Visible Layered Dimensions
- "political dimensions of how we position ourselves—and are positioned"
- Reveals how design choices (interface, taxonomy, encoding) shape what becomes visible
- Shows how AI's interpretive framework constrains relational imagination

### ✅ Political, Ethical, Societal Dimensions
- "foreclosing relational possibilities" = ethical concern
- "systematically reduce" = political critique
- "constrain relational imagination" = societal impact

## Recommendation

**Use Version 1** (Foregrounding Foreclosure) because:
- Opens with the critical question that DIS reviewers care about
- Immediately surfaces what's being foreclosed
- Maintains empirical grounding (345 conversations, 82x variance, etc.)
- Ends with political dimensions and challenging dyadic model
- 149 words (under limit)

**Alternative:** If you want to lead with the visualization contribution, use **Version 3** (Balanced), which still foregrounds foreclosure but starts with the system.

## Next Steps

1. Choose version (recommend Version 1)
2. Verify word count matches submission requirements
3. Ensure all numbers are accurate (345, 82x, 82.7%, 7 patterns, <3%)
4. Consider if you want to mention "Beyond Interaction" explicitly (could add 5-10 words)
