# Cleanup Temp Files in Classifier Directory

## Temporary Files Status

The following files in `classifier/` are **temporary/generated files** that can be safely removed or regenerated:

### Temp JSON Files (Can be Regenerated)

1. **`conversations-for-classifier.json`** (143KB)
   - **Purpose:** Prepared conversations for classification
   - **Generated by:** `classify.sh` when no input specified
   - **Status:** Can be regenerated anytime
   - **Action:** ✅ Already in `.gitignore`, safe to delete

2. **`unclassified-conversations.json`** (11KB)
   - **Purpose:** List of conversations that need classification
   - **Generated by:** `classify.sh` when checking for unclassified
   - **Status:** Can be regenerated anytime
   - **Action:** ✅ Already in `.gitignore`, safe to delete

3. **`unclassified-emo-conversations.json`** (16KB)
   - **Purpose:** List of emo conversations that need classification
   - **Generated by:** `classify-emo-files.py`
   - **Status:** Can be regenerated anytime
   - **Action:** ✅ Already in `.gitignore`, safe to delete

## Safe to Remove

All three files are:
- ✅ Already in `.gitignore` (won't be tracked)
- ✅ Generated automatically by scripts
- ✅ Can be recreated by running the classification scripts

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Remove Now (Recommended)**
```bash
cd classifier
rm conversations-for-classifier.json unclassified-conversations.json unclassified-emo-conversations.json
```
These will be regenerated the next time you run:
- `./classify.sh` → creates `unclassified-conversations.json`
- `./classify-remaining-emo.sh` → creates `unclassified-emo-conversations.json`

**Option 2: Keep for Reference**
- If you're in the middle of classification, you can keep them
- They'll be regenerated anyway if you run the scripts again

## Verification

All temp files are properly excluded from git:
```gitignore
# Temporary classifier files (can be regenerated)
classifier/unclassified-*.json
classifier/conversations-for-classifier.json
```
