Here's an easy LeetCode-style question for you:\n\nGiven a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single number.\n\nYou may assume that there will always be one odd-occurring element in the array, and your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. You should also implement it without using extra memory.\n\nPlease write a function called `singleNumber` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the single number.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: `nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`\n\nOutput: `4`\n\nYou can ask any questions to clarify the problem, and when you're ready, you can provide your code implementation."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Your solution is already quite efficient and meets the requirements of the problem statement. Using the XOR operation is a clever approach to solving this problem without needing extra memory. \n\nOne minor suggestion is to add a docstring to your function to explain what it does, the input, and the output. This would make it more readable and easier to understand for others who might come across your code. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ndef singleNumber(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the single number in a list of integers where every other element appears twice.\n    \n    Args:\n    nums (List[int]): A list of integers where every element appears twice, except for one.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The single number that appears only once in the list.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        result ^= num\n    return result\n```\n\nOther than that, your solution is well done and efficient!"
