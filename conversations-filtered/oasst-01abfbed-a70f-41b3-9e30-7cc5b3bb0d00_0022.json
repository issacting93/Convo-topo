Once the dongle is connected and recognized by the tablet, you can use the Google Maps app to navigate in your car by providing turn-by-turn directions. Please note that you'll need an internet connection for Google Maps to work, as the app requires access to maps and traffic information. Additionally, while Google Maps can use your GPS location to provide navigation, a dedicated GPS device may provide a more accurate and reliable signal compared to a tablet or smartphone."

      "content": "Both accessing Google Maps through a web browser and using the Google Maps app from the Microsoft Store can provide navigation functionality on your Microsoft Surface tablet. However, using the app may provide a better experience as it is optimized for touch input and can offer additional features such as real-time traffic updates and voice-guided navigation. Additionally, using the app may also work better in areas with limited internet connectivity, as it can cache map data for offline use. Ultimately, the choice between using the app or the web browser comes down to personal preference and the specific features that you require."

If you plan to use the dongle for extended periods of time, you may want to consider one with a longer battery life.\n\nData transfer speed: Some GPS dongles can transfer data faster than others, which can be beneficial for more demanding applications. However, this may not be a major concern if you're only using the dongle for basic navigation purposes.\n\nCost: GPS dongles are available at a wide range of price points, so you may want to consider your budget when making your selection.\n\nBy considering these factors, you should be able to find a GPS dongle that meets your needs and works well with your Microsoft Surface tablet."
