      "content": "The phrase \"እድሜ በራዊ ነገር ከምንቲ ናይ\" is in the Amharic language and it is a proverbial phrase.\n\nThe translation of this phrase is \"The lion makes the thicket shake, but the hyena gets the prey.\" It is a metaphor that compares the strength and bravery of a lion to the cunning and opportunism of a hyena. The phrase is often used to describe someone who is strong and powerful, but also someone who is sly and takes advantage of others."

      "content": "Here is a logic puzzle that can help determine the finishing order of the five people eating apples:\n\n1. If A finished before B, then A started eating before B started eating.\n2. If C finished before D, then C started eating before D started eating.\n3. If A finished before C, then A started eating before C started eating.\n4. If B finished after A, then B started eating after A started eating.\n5. If D finished after B, then D started eating after B started eating.\n6. If E finished after D, then E started eating after D started eating.\n\nUsing these statements, we can deduce the finishing order of the five people as follows:\n\n1. Since A finished before B, and B finished after A, then B finished after A started eating.\n2. Since C finished before D, and D finished after B, then D started eating after B started eating.\n3. Since A finished before C, and C finished before D, then C started eating before D started eating.\n4. Since B finished after A, and A finished before C, then B finished after C started eating.\n5. Since D finished after B, and B finished after A, then D finished after A started eating.\n6. Since E finished after D, and D finished after B, then E finished after B started eating.\n\nTherefore, the finishing order of the five people eating apples is: E, D, C, B, A."
