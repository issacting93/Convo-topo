      "content": "AntLR (Artificial LanguaR) is a parser generator for the Java programming language. It can be used to develop compilers, interpreters, and tools that parse text files containing programming language syntax.\n\nHere's an example of how to use AntLR to parse a simple programming language syntax file:\n\n1.\tCreate a new AntLR project in your preferred development environment.\n2.\tAdd the AntLR library to your project. You can do this by downloading the library from the AntLR website and adding the library to your project's build path.\n3.\tCreate a syntax file that defines the syntax of your programming language. This file should contain the rules for parsing the language, such as the syntax for variables, functions, and statements.\n4.\tWrite the rules for parsing your programming language in the syntax file. AntLR provides a set of built-in rules for common programming language syntax, but you can also define your own rules as needed.\n5.\tSave the syntax file.\n6.\tCompile the syntax file into a Java class file.\n7.\tCreate a test case that uses the AntLR parser to parse a sample program. You can use the generated parser class to parse the program and verify that the parse tree accurately reflects the program's syntax.\n8.\tRun the test case. If the test case passes, your AntLR parser is functioning correctly.\n\nNote: AntLR is a powerful tool, but it can be a bit complex to learn and use. If you are new to parser generation, it may be easier to start with simpler languages or to use a simpler parser generator like ANTLR 4."

      "content": "Yes, there are several compact JSON equivalants. One popular option is JSONStream, which is a streaming JSON encoder/decoder implementation. JSONStream provides a simple and efficient interface for encoding and decoding JSON data, and it is designed to be lightweight and efficient.\n\nAnother option is JSONP, which is a short-hand for JSONP (JSON with padding). JSONP is a way of making JSON requests to a server without having to include the JSON data in the request URL. Instead, the data is sent as a separate request, which is then combined with the original request in the server. JSONP is used to make cross-domain requests more efficient, but it can also be used to simplify the implementation of JSON-using APIs.\n\nFinally, JSON-Anywhere is a library that makes it easy to write JSON-using applications, without having to write complex code. JSON-Anywhere provides a simple and intuitive API for encoding and decoding JSON data, and it can be used to create JSON-based applications in a variety of programming languages.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several compact JSON equivalants available, including JSONStream, JSONP, and JSON-Anywhere. Each of these options has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it is important to choose the one that best fits your specific needs and requirements."
