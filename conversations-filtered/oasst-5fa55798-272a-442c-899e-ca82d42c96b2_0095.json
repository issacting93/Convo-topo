      "content": "• Leak tantalizing yet vague details to select media mouths known for loud and breathless speculation. The hype machine will do the promotional work for you.\n\n• Frame your event or activity as either a grave threat to society that must be stopped, or an unprecedented opportunity that must be seized now before it's too late. Sensationalism draws eyes and sells clicks.\n\n• Include lots of exclamation points and superlatives in the press release!!! The most incredible event of the century cannot be missed!!!! Neither can excessive punctuation.\n\n• Promise the press \"exclusive access\" or \"inside information.\" Nothing motivates media coverage like special treatment and the illusion of privileged access.\n\n• Have a celebrity (any celebrity!) show up to your event. Cameras and journalists will flock to fame like moths to a flame. The actual relevance of said celebrity is optional.\n\n• If all else fails, just repeatedly yell, \"Look at me! Look at me!\" until the press turns their cameras and pens in your direction. Desperate times call for shameless measures."
