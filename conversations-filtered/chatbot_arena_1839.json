You are correct that I provided an opinion about the father of the internet, which was a response that was based on my understanding of the topic and the information that was available to me at that time. However, I can see how the response could be perceived as a statement, and I understand why you might have felt that way. I will make sure to be more clear in the future and avoid any confusion. Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
