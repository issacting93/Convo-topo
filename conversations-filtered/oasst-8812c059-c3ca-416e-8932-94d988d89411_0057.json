Before going to sleep, plan what you want to do tomorrow. A good schedule will motivate you more.\n3. Get rid of distractions. Avoid working behind a computer screen if a task can also be done offline. Otherwise, close as much unnecessary applications as possible.\n4. Keep track of progress you made. Procrastination often occurs when you feel like you're stuck. Seeing the steps you have made will give you a sense of momentum to keep things going.\n5. Do something active. Working out does wonders for your motivation. \n6. Set hard deadlines for certain small things. Don't go to bed until task X is fully finished.\n7. Be kind to yourself. Procastination entails that while you are currently not working on the task, the intent to finish it is still there. As long as you have not given up on your project, things will be okay!\n8. Perfect is the enemy of the good. Do not let your time get sucked up by a single task. Keep momentum high and move on from a task as soon as it meets the requirements. You can always come back later to perfect it.\n9. Talk with other people about your struggles. Explaining your problems to someone else might help you understand the cause of your procrastination behavior better.\n10. Stop worrying! You will feel exactly like this another million times and you will find a way to solve it a million times as well. Might as well enjoy life along the way!"

      "content": "Here are the top 10 ways of overcoming procrastination:\n\n1. Identify the reasons behind your procrastination: Once you understand the cause, try dissociating from it by changing your mindset. For example, if getting messages on your phone is distracting, turn off your phone and mentally separate yourself from the need to constantly check it.\n\n2. Set clear goals and prioritize tasks: Prioritize your tasks based on their importance and urgency, make your environment help you by putting things in places that are easy to reach and make your environment work against bad habits that cause procrastination.\n\n3. Break tasks into smaller, manageable chunks: Accomplishing smaller tasks can stimulate your dopaminergic systems, making it easier to keep working and build momentum.\n\n4. Use focus-enhancing techniques: There are many techniques to help you focus, and one of them is the Pomodoro Technique.\n\n5. Eliminate distractions: Remove any distractions that might sidetrack you, and inform those around you that you need to focus without being disturbed.\n\n6. Focus on the process and track your progress: Focus on the process of completing tasks rather than just the outcome, and you can keep track of your progress through journaling and, if necessary, therapy. These two strategies work well together to help you stay on track by organizing your thoughts, objectives and dreams.\n\n7. Maintain physical and mental health and practice mindfulness: Stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked by distractions through mindfulness practices. Taking care of your physical health, such as exercising regularly, can make a big difference in your mental health and help you overcome procrastination. A healthy routine can reduce stress levels, allowing you to make better decisions and focus on long-term happiness rather than instant gratification.\n\n8. Practice positive self-talk and take responsibility for your own progress: Encourage yourself with positive affirmations and self-talk to stay motivated. While it's always great if others can help you overcome procrastination, it's important to not rely on them and take responsibility for your own progress.\n\n9. Reward yourself: Set up a reward system that is healthy and simple, such as playing games or chatting with loved ones, instead of unhealthy habits like junk food or drugs.\n\n10. Cultivate a positive mindset: Cultivating a growth mindset, which focuses on the belief that you can grow and improve, and surrounding yourself with positivity, such as inspirational posters or art, can help you overcome procrastination. These two strategies can work together to help you stay motivated and focused."
