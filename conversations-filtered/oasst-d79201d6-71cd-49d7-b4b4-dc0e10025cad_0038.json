Save the above code to a file with a .c extension, for example hello_world.c.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n3. Compile the program by running the following command:\n```gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c```\n4. Run the compiled program by typing the following command:\n```./hello_world```\n5. You should see the output Hello World! displayed in the terminal.\n\nNote: The above instructions are for a Unix-based system. If you are using Windows, you may need to use a different compiler or set up a development environment."

The method of installation depends on the operating system you are using.\n\nFor a Debian or Ubuntu-based system, you can install GCC by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nFor a Fedora-based system, you can install GCC by running the following command:\nsudo dnf install gcc\n\nFor a CentOS-based system, you can install GCC by running the following command:\nsudo yum install gcc\n\nFor a Windows system, you can download and install MinGW or MinGW-w64, which provides a GCC compiler for Windows.\n\nAfter installing GCC, try running the commands again to compile and run the \"Hello World\" program."

      "content": "To add user input to your C program, you can use the \"scanf\" function from the standard input library, \"stdio.h\". This function reads input from the user and stores it in a specified variable. Here's an example of how to modify the \"Hello World\" program to include user input:\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main()\n{\nchar name[20];\nprintf(\"Enter your name: \");\nscanf(\"%s\", name);\nprintf(\"Hello %s\\n\", name);\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nIn this program, the \"scanf\" function is used to read a string (up to 19 characters) from the user and store it in the \"name\" variable. The user is prompted to enter their name with the \"Enter your name:\" message. Then, the \"printf\" function is used to print a personalized greeting to the user, using the value stored in the \"name\" variable.\n\nCompiling and running the program is the same as before. Note that the size of the \"name\" array should be one more than the maximum number of characters you want to allow, as it needs to store the null terminator character."
