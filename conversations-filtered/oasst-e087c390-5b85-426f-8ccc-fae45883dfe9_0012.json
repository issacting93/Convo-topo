      "content": "Mechanical keyboards are popular among gamers, programmers, and anyone who types for extended periods. These keyboards use mechanical switches instead of the rubber domes used in traditional keyboards. Mechanical switches provide tactile feedback, which results in a more satisfying typing experience. There are several types of mechanical keyboard switches, including:\n\n1. Cherry MX switches: These are some of the most popular mechanical switches and are used in many high-end keyboards. They come in different colors, each with different properties.\n    - Cherry MX Red switches have a linear feel and require less force to actuate. They are preferred by gamers for their fast response time.\n    - Cherry MX Brown switches have a tactile bump and are quieter than other switches. They are preferred by typists for their tactile feedback.\n    - Cherry MX Blue switches have a tactile bump and an audible click, making them the loudest switches. They are also preferred by typists for their tactile feedback.\n\n2. Kailh switches: These are Chinese-made switches that are similar to Cherry MX switches. They are cheaper than Cherrie MX switches and are becoming more popular.\n    - Kailh Red switches are linear and require less force to actuate.\n    - Kailh Brown switches have a tactile bump and are quieter than other switches.\n    - Kailh Blue switches have a tactile bump and an audible click, making them similar to Cherry MX Blue switches.\n\n3. Gateron switches: These are similar to Cherry MX switches but are made by a Chinese company. They are cheaper than     - Cherry MX switches and are becoming more popular.\n    - Gateron Red switches are linear and require less force to actuate.\n    - Gateron Brown switches have a tactile bump and are quieter than other switches.\n    - Gateron Blue switches have a tactile bump and an audible click, making them similar to Cherry MX Blue switches.\n\n4. Topre switches: These are electrostatic capacitive switches that provide a different typing experience. They are quieter and require less force to actuate.\n    - Topre switches have a tactile bump and are preferred by typists for their typing experience.\n\n5. Buckling Spring switches: These switches use a spring and a plastic cylinder to provide tactile feedback. They are the loudest and heaviest switches.\n    - Buckling Spring switches have a tactile bump and an audible click. They are preferred by typists for their tactile feedback."

      "content": "Choosing a key switch when limited to online resources can at first seem intimidating. The choice to use a specific switch is highly individual and based on the specific wants / needs of a user.\nIf you aren't super picky and a new user, a common recommendation are Cherry MX Brown or equivalent switches. They offer both the benefits of a mechanical key switch (more precise and reliable) as well as a familiar tactile \"bump\" and actuation force common on most membrane keyboards.\n\nHowever, if you would like to do more research, there are a couple ways you can accomplish this online only.\n\n1. The official website: A brands official website (https://www.gateron.com/ and https://www.cherrymx.de/en) will often describe the switch using common language and terms (actuation force, tactility, sound, etc.), this can be helpful for comparing the details of different brands and their individual switch types. \n\n2. Individual reviewers: Keyboards are often both a gamer and pc enthusiasts favourite accessory, as such there are a plethora of different reviews for all types of keyboards, keyswitches, and even different \"mods\" such as rubber dampers and keycap weight. Keyboard content is truly endless.\n\n3. In person: I understand you would like to shop online, however keyboards are frequently on display at different stores which can give you a feel for what you could be getting yourself into before purchasing a keyboard elsewhere.\n\nWhile trying out switches in person is ideal, these alternative methods can help you make a more informed decision when purchasing a keyboard online. It's also worth noting that many mechanical keyboards offer hot-swappable switches, which allow you to easily swap out switch types without having to purchase a new keyboard."

      "content": "Trying out switches in person is definitely the best way to get a feel for them, but if that's not possible, there are a few other things you can do to make an informed decision when shopping for switches online.\n\nFirst, you can read reviews and watch videos of people using the switches you're interested in. This can give you an idea of the general feel and sound of the switch.\n\nSecond, you can purchase a switch tester. These are small devices that contain several different switches for you to try out. They are relatively inexpensive and can be a good way to get a feel for different switch types before making a larger investment.\n\nFinally, some keyboard manufacturers offer a return policy, so you can try out a keyboard with the switches you're interested in and return it if you're not satisfied. Be sure to check the return policy before making a purchase to ensure you have that option.\n\nUltimately, it's important to do your research and understand what you're looking for in a switch before making a purchase. With some careful consideration and a bit of experimentation, you should be able to find a switch that works well for you."

      "content": "Yes, it's a good idea to help get to know what you prefer.  I recommend that you search for and order a \"keyboard switch sampler\" or \"keyboard switch tester\" which allows you to test out each type of switch for a specific brand.  These have each type of switch arranged in a supportive grid to where you can compare the properties of each.  These are significantly less expensive than purchasing different mechanical keyboards with specific switches.  Alternately, you can visit electronics stores that feature different brands of keyboards on display to try."

Examples include the Cherry MX Brown and the Kailh Speed Bronze.\n\nClicky switches: These switches provide a distinct clicking sound as you press down on the key, similar to the sound of a typewriter. Examples include the Cherry MX Blue and the Kailh Speed Silver.\n\nMechanical keyboard switches are generally considered to be more durable and reliable than other types of keyboard switches, such as membrane or dome switches. They are also more customizable, as they can be easily swapped out to change the feel and sound of the keyboard."

      "content": "Mechanical keyboard switches are physical mechanisms under each key of a mechanical keyboard that detect when the key is pressed down. There are three types of mechanical keyboard switches: linear switches, tactile switches and clicky switches.\n\nThe three types of switches can be distinguished by their motion and feedback. Linear switches have a uniform and smooth motion, resulting in a quiet and seamless typing experience. Tactile switches offer more tactile feedback as the key lightly resists the press for a firmer feel. Clicky switches give the most feedback, offering a distinct \"click-like\" sound and a snappy key movement."
