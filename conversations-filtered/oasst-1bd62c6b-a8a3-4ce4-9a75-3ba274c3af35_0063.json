For example, the following code creates a simple 2x2 table with centered columns:\n``` \n\\begin{array}{c|c}\na & b \\\\\n\\hline\nc & d\n\\end{array}\n``` \nThis produces the following table:\n```\na|b\n---\nc|d \n```\nYou can adjust the column specification to create tables with different layouts and alignment options. For more information and examples, you can refer to the MathJax documentation on tables: https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/arrays.html."

Here is an example of a simple table with two columns and three rows:\n\n```latex\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Column 1} & \\text{Column 2} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Row 1, Column 1} & \\text{Row 1, Column 2} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Row 2, Column 1} & \\text{Row 2, Column 2} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Row 3, Column 1} & \\text{Row 3, Column 2} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n```\n\nThis will produce a table with a border, two centered columns, and three rows. You can customize the table by changing the number of columns and rows, adding or removing borders, changing the alignment of the columns, and adding more complex formatting.\n\nNote that you need to enclose the table code within double dollar signs ($$) to render it as a MathJax display equation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code above:\n\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}: This command starts the array environment and specifies the format of the table. | creates a vertical border, c centers the text in the column, and || creates a double vertical border between the columns.\n\\hline: This command creates a horizontal border.\nRow 1, Column 1 and Row 1, Column 2: These are the entries in the first row of the table.\n\\end{array}: This command ends the array environment.\nYou can replace the text in the table with your own data, and adjust the formatting as needed.\n\nI hope this helps!"

      "content": "To show that a² + b² / ab + 1 is the square of an integer, we need to find an integer k such that:\n\na² + b² / ab + 1 = k²\n\nTo start, we can simplify the expression on the left-hand side by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by a - b:\n\n(a² + b²)(a - b) / (ab + 1)(a - b) = k²\n\nExpanding the numerator on the left-hand side and canceling out the common factor of a - b in both the numerator and denominator, we get:\n\n(a³ - b³) + ab(a - b) / (a²b - ab²) + 1 = k²\n\nSince ab + 1 divides a² + b², we can write:\n\na² + b² = n(ab + 1)\n\nwhere n is some positive integer. Substituting this expression into the numerator of the left-hand side, we get:\n\n(a³ - b³) + ab(a - b) = a³ - b³ + ab(a - b) = (a - b)(a² - ab + b²) = (a - b)n\n\nSubstituting this expression back into our original equation and simplifying, we get:\n\n(a - b)n / ab - 1 = k²\n\nMultiplying both sides by ab - 1, we get:\n\n(a - b)n = k²(ab - 1)\n\nSince a, b, and n are positive integers, we have:\n\na - b > 0 and ab - 1 > 0\n\nTherefore, k² must also be a positive integer, and we can write:\n\nk² = (a - b)n / (ab - 1)\n\nNow we need to show that k is an integer. To do this, we will use the fact that ab + 1 divides a² + b². This can be written as:\n\na² + b² = m(ab + 1)\n\nwhere m is some positive integer. Substituting this expression into the original equation, we get:\n\nm(ab + 1) / ab + 1 = k²\n\nMultiplying both sides by ab + 1, we get:\n\nm(ab + 1) = k²(ab + 1)\n\nExpanding the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:\n\nmab + m = k²ab + k²\n\nDividing both sides by ab, we get:\n\nm/a + m/b = k² + m/(ab)\n\nSince m/(ab) is a positive integer and m/a and m/b are both positive integers, k² must also be a positive integer, and k is an integer.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that a² + b² / ab + 1 is the square of an integer."

      "content": "To prove that \\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1} is the square of an integer, we can start by expressing \\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1} as the sum of two fractions:\n\n\\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1}=\\frac{a^2+2ab+b^2-2ab}{ab+1}=\\frac{(a+b)^2-2ab}{ab+1}.\n\nNow, we notice that ab+1 divides a^2+b^2, which means that there exists an integer k such that a^2+b^2=k(ab+1). Rearranging, we get:\n\n(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = k(ab+1) + 2ab = (kb+2)a + k.\n\nSince (a+b)^2 is always a perfect square, we can assume that (a+b)^2 = m^2 for some positive integer m. Substituting this in the above equation, we get:\n\nm^2 = (kb+2)a + k.\n\nRearranging and solving for a, we get:\n\na = \\frac{m^2-k}{kb+2}.\n\nNow we can substitute this value of a in our expression for \\frac{(a+b)^2-2ab}{ab+1}, to get:\n\n\\frac{(a+b)^2-2ab}{ab+1}=\\frac{m^2-2kbm+k^2+4k}{(kb+2)^2}.\n\nWe want to show that this is the square of an integer, so we can try to find an integer n such that:\n\nn^2 = \\frac{m^2-2kbm+k^2+4k}{(kb+2)^2}.\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n(kb+2)^2 n^2 = m^2 - 2kbm + k^2 + 4k.\n\nExpanding the left-hand side and simplifying, we get:\n\n(k^2-4) n^2 = m^2 - 2abm - 4k.\n\nBut we know that m^2 = (kb+2)^2 n^2, and we have already expressed a in terms of m, k, and b, so we can substitute these values in the above equation to get:\n\n(k^2-4) n^2 = (kb+2)^2 n^2 - 2(kb+2)(m^2-k) - 4k.\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n(k^2-4) n^2 = (kb+2)(4-k^2) - 4k.\n\nNow, since k and b are both positive integers, we can assume that kb+2 is also a positive integer. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the above equation by kb+2 to get:\n\nn^2 = \\frac{(4-k^2) - 4k/(kb+2)}{k^2-4}.\n\nNow, the right-hand side of this equation is a rational number, and we want to show that it is the square of an integer. This means that the numerator and denominator must both be perfect squares. We can see that (4-k^2) is a perfect square if and only if k=1 or k=2. Checking these cases separately, we can show that the numerator and denominator are both perfect squares. Therefore, we have proved that \\frac{a^2+b^2}{ab+1} is the square of an integer."
