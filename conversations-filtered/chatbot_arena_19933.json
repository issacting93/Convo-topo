The \"INT\" data type is used to define the column types, and \"TIMESTAMP\" is used to define the \"createdAt\" and \"deletedAt\" columns as timestamps.\n\nYou can run this query on a PostgreSQL database to create the table. Once the table is created, you can create, insert, update, and delete data on it using SQL commands."

      "content": "Here is a simple Python program that uses the `` discord.py `` library to create a Discord bot and a server, and define a command that can be used to send a message to the server with a specific message text:\n\n\n```python\nimport discord\n\nclient = discord.Client()\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_message(message):\n    if message.author == client.user:\n        return\n    # check if the message is a command\n    if message.content.startswith('!hello'):\n        response = \"Hello, {message.channel.name.replace(' ', '_')}!\".format(message.channel)\n        await message.channel.send(\"You said: \" + response)\n\nclient.run('TOKEN_HERE')\n\n```\n\nThis script creates a `` discord.Client `` object named `` client ``, which is used to handle events such as new messages being received. The `` on_message `` event is used to check if the message received is a command, and if so, it formats the channel name with underscores instead of spaces to avoid issues with special characters, and sends a response message to the channel using the `` channel.send `` method.\n\nTo use this script, you will need to replace `` TOKEN_HERE `` with your own Discord bot token. You can obtain a token by going to the Discord Developer Portal and creating a new application. Once you have obtained a token, you can use it in the script as shown above.\n\nNote that this is just a very basic example to get you started with the `` discord.py `` library. In a real-world application, you would likely want to add more functionality and error handling to your bot, as well as add more commands and responses to handle a wider range of user input."
