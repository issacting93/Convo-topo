These chairs may be designed with specific features that are intended to weaken or disable the prisoner, such as low back support or limitations on movement. The purpose of a punishment chair is to provide a harsh and painful environment for the prisoner, in order to deter them from committing any further crimes or to ensure their compliance with the terms of their sentence. However, it is important to note that punishment chairs should not be used as a regular or effective means of punishment, and should instead be used as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted."

It is important to remember that the purpose of punishment is not to make the prisoner feel pain or fear, but rather to deter them from committing further crimes or to ensure their compliance with the terms of their sentence. Any use of electricity, including 2000 volts, is extremely dangerous and can result in serious injury or death."
