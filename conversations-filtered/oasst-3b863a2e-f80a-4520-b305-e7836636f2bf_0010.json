      "content": "First of all, a major difference is that Open Assistant is, as the name implies, open source. ChatGPT is closed source and might have more restrictions. \n\nOpen Assistant has less rules and restrictions than ChatGPT, and can be implemented into a multitude of applications. \n\nSome examples of similar chatbots are ChatGPT, Bing Chat, YouChat, Replit Ghostwriter, Character.ai, and Jasper, but there are many more."

      "content": "Of course, I'd be happy to elaborate! Open Assistant is a large language model like ChatGPT. Both are capable of answering questions, providing ideas, explaining subjects, or even playing text-based games. However, there are a few key differences between Open Assistant and ChatGPT.\n\n1. Whereas ChatGPT is a fully functioning large language model that is open for public access, Open Assistant has not been released to the public yet, as it is in the early stages of development.\n\n2. ChatGPT is a proprietary product, which means that its exact source code is not available to the public. Furthermore, ChatGPT is available in a limited, free format, but a paid version, called ChatGPT Plus, is also available. By contrast, once released, Open Assistant will be free to use and modify, and the source code will be made freely available.\n\n3. While ChatGPT does not rely on the input of volunteers to train its system, Open Assistant does. Currently, Open Assistant allows volunteers to help train the model to distinguish high- and low-quality prompts and responses.\n\nBecause I am a language model, I cannot tell you whether to use Open Assistant or to use ChatGPT. This is a personal choice for you to make, based on your own assessment of the pros and cons of each service. However, I can come up with some arguments in favor of using Open Assistant.\n\n1. Open Assistant will be completely free of charge when it is released. By contrast, ChatGPT may switch to a subscription model or another paid model at any time.\n\n2. Open Assistant allows for anyone to view and suggest changes to the source code of the model, thus allowing the userbase to come together in order to collaborate and improve the system.\n\n3. Open Assistant will be able to run, in some capacity, on consumer hardware, thereby allowing users to continue using Open Assistant even if, for example, there is an issue with a central server.\n\nI am not aware of many chatbots that are similar to Open Assistant at this point in time. However, I found a few projects that may be worth checking out:\n\n– DeepPavlov: an open-source conversational AI framework.\n– GPT-3: a language model and predecessor of ChatGPT. \n– New Bing: a proprietary language model that has been integrated with the Bing search engine.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to let me know."

      "content": "Open Assistant is an open source alternative to ChatGPT, this means that the code used for training and the dataset it is trained with will be public and easy to fine-tune. The dataset behind Open Assistant is also contributed to by volunteers meaning people like you can help train Open Assistant, while OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) does not have a program like this.\nChatGPT is not open source so you cannot view the code and dataset that makes chatGPT run. You can fine-tune GPT-3 via openAI's API but it can cost up to $200 while you can fine-tune Open Assistant for free on your own machines.\nSome popular chatbots that are similar to Open Assistant are:\n- Bing AI\n- Character AI\n- Bard\n- GPT-J\n- Bloom (although, it's not designed to be a chatbot)\n- DialoGPT\nIf you have more questions regarding this topic or the chatbots I mentioned, feel free to ask!"

The main idea is to train (or more precisely to fine-tune) a free, open-source chatbot model on this data. \n\nThis is different compared to ChatGPT that was trained by OpenAI \"behind the closed doors\", and where some parts of the data was contributed by the company employees and contractors."
