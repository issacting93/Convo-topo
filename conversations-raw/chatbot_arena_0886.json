      "content": "Jim Crow was a series of laws enacted in the United States from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century that enforced racial segregation. The laws, which were mainly enforced in the former Confederacy, had a devastating effect on African Americans, denying them basic civil rights and restricting their access to public spaces and institutions. The laws were named after a character in a minstrel show who was portrayed as a lazy and dimwitted slave."
