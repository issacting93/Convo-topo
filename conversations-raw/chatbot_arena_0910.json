Here is an example of how you can do this in Python using the csv module:\n\nimport csv\n\n# Open the CSV file\nwith open('rewards.csv', 'r') as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    header = next(reader) # skip the header row\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to store the data\n    data = {}\n    \n    # Loop through the rows in the CSV file\n    for row in reader:\n        # Extract the values from the row\n        step, mean_reward, std_reward = row\n        \n        # Add the data to the dictionary\n        data[step] = (mean_reward, std_reward)\n    \n        # Print the data to the console\n        print(f'Step {step}: Mean Reward {mean_reward} | Std Reward {std_reward}')\n\nThis code assumes that the rewards.csv file contains a header row with the columns step, mean_reward, and std_reward. The code then opens the file, creates a reader object from the csv.reader() function, and skip the header row using the next() function. The code then loops through the rows in the file, extracts the values from each row, adds the data to a dictionary, and prints the data to the console."

      "content": "Sure, here's an example of how you can plot the mean and standard deviation of the rewards in your CSV file using matplotlib in Python:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('rewards.csv')\n\n# Plot the mean reward\nplt.plot(df['mean_reward'], label='Mean Reward')\n\n# Plot the standard deviation of the reward\nplt.plot(df['std_reward'], label='Standard Deviation of Reward')\n\n# Add labels to the plot\nplt.xlabel('Step')\nplt.ylabel('Reward')\nplt.title('Mean and Standard Deviation of Rewards')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\nThis code uses the pandas library to read the CSV file and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame. The dataframe contains the mean and standard deviation of the rewards for each step. Then, it is used to create a plot using the matplotlib library. The plot shows the mean reward as a line and the standard deviation of the reward as a red polygon above and below the mean reward. Finally, the plot is displayed using the show() method."
