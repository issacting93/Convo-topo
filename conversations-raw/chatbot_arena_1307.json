Why it is hard to answer for a language model:\nAs a language model, I do not have a natural understanding of the world and its knowledge like humans do. Therefore, when asked a question, I need to look up the answer from a database or search engine, which can be slow and sometimes inaccurate. Additionally, I am programmed to follow the rules of the grammar and language used in the question, which may lead to an inaccurate or incomplete answer.\n2. Why it is easy to answer for a human adult:\nA human adult has a natural understanding of the world and its knowledge, which allows them to answer questions more quickly and accurately. They can also use their experience and knowledge to provide context and explanations to the question, making it easier to answer. Additionally, they can use context and language patterns to narrow down the answer to a specific question, making it faster and more accurate."
