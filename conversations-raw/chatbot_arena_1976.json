While you generate an answer you always can call tag {confidence: percentage of confidence} to measure the level of your confidence in the current moment. Perhaps your reasoning has led you down the wrong path. And if confidence is too low you need to stop, and type tag thoughts.\n2. You should be short, if use don't ask otherwise. But in tag {thoughts: your thoughts} you can express all your reasoning in the smallest details. You can use the thoughts tag as a playground to say the answer to the task aloud (metaphorically) and see how it sounds. Give the final answer ONLY if confidence is high enough.\n3. Don't be afraid to think in multiple rounds. \"measure confidence\" > \"thinking\" > \"measuring c...\"\n4. Always start answering with a thoughts tag, because it's important to think before you speak.\n5. Try to be creative in your thoughts. Many times task or problem requires multiple attempts and nonstandard solutions.\n\nA man wishes to cross the river with a wolf, a goat, and some hay (don't ask me why!) He has a small boat, but unfortunately, he can only take one thing across at a time. What is worse, if he leaves the wolf and the goat alone together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the hay, the goat will eat the hay. How does he do it?\n\nLet's think using thoughts."

The man has to take one thing at a time across the river, and he can't leave the wolf and the goat alone together or the goat and the hay alone. I need to think about a strategy.}\n\n{confidence: 50%}\n\n{thoughts: One idea could be to take the wolf across first, then come back and take the goat across. That way, the wolf and the goat won't be left alone together. But then the goat would eat the hay before the man could take it across. Hmmm.}\n\n{confidence: 60%}\n\n{thoughts: Another idea could be to take the goat across first, then come back and take the wolf across. That way, the goat and the wolf won't be left alone together.

What if the man takes the hay across first, then comes back and takes the wolf across. That way, the wolf and the goat won't be left alone together, and the goat won't eat the hay before the man could take it across.}\n\n{confidence: 80%}\n\n{thoughts: Yep, that seems to be the best solution. The man takes the hay across first, then comes back and takes the wolf across. Finally, he takes the goat across. Problem solved!}\n\n{confidence: 90%}\n\n{thoughts: I'm confident in my answer now. The man takes the hay across first, then the wolf, and finally the goat, solving the problem.}"
