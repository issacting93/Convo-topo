Life expectancy figures change over time based on many factors, so without recent data I could not answer that confidently.\n\nSome of the other questions I would feel more comfortable answering based on general knowledge, but for precise questions of fact like life expectancy rankings, I would defer unless I have current data and statistics on that topic."
