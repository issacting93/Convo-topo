The only information I have is:\n\n1) You are sitting on a bus \n2) The woman sitting to your left is wearing orange\n3) The man sitting to her right is wearing pink\n\nThis does not provide any information about what color clothing you have on. I do not have a way to determine that from the information provided."

Based on the additional information, if the woman sitting to your left is wearing orange, and you are the man sitting to her right, then you must be wearing pink.\n\nMy apologies for the confusion, I should have asked follow up questions earlier to get clarification rather than stating that I did not have enough information. I will learn from this experience, and try to ask more clarifying questions in the future before concluding I do not have enough information to determine the answer."
