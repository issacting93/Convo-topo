      "content": "Imaginary numbers are mathematical concepts that are used in complex analysis and calculus. They are numbers that are not real numbers, but rather they are numbers that have a real part and an imaginary part. These numbers are used to represent mathematical concepts such as angles, rotations, and velocities. They are also used in calculus to solve problems that involve both real and imaginary numbers."
