I would also work to provide Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance. I would make it clear to Russia that any further aggression would be met with a strong and united response from the United States and its allies.\r\n\r\nI would also work to de-escalate the situation through diplomacy. I would reach out to Russian President Vladimir Putin and try to find a way to resolve the conflict peacefully. I would also work with other world leaders to find a solution that would be acceptable to both Russia and Ukraine.\r\n\r\nI would do everything in my power to protect the people of Ukraine and to ensure that their sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected."
