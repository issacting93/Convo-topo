      "content": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy regulation that affects businesses operating within the European Union (EU). It was implemented on May 25, 2018, with the aim of strengthening data protection for individuals within the EU and harmonizing data privacy laws across the region.\n\nThe GDPR sets out several key principles, including:\n\n1. Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency: Personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.\n\n2. Purpose limitation: Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not further processed in a way incompatible with those purposes.\n\n3. Data minimization: The collection of personal data should be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes it serves.\n\n4. Accuracy: Personal data should be accurate and kept up to date, with reasonable steps taken to correct or delete inaccurate data.\n\n5. Storage limitation: Personal data should be retained only for as long as necessary for the purposes it was collected for.\n\n6. Integrity and confidentiality: Personal data must be processed securely, with appropriate measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction.\n\n7. Accountability: Data controllers are responsible for ensuring that they comply with GDPR principles and can demonstrate compliance.\n\nThe GDPR also provides individuals with several rights, such as the right to access, rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of their personal data, as well as the right to data portability and the right to object to certain types of data processing.\n\nNon-compliance with the GDPR can result in significant fines and penalties for businesses, up to 4% of their global annual turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher."
