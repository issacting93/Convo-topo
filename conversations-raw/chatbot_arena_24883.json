      "content": "In AI, an iteration is a type of step. Each step is composed of a condition, action, and evaluation. An example of each is as follows:\n\nCondition: If the temperature is below 55 degrees\nAction: Increase the temperature to 60 degrees\nEvaluation: The temperature is now at 60 degrees\n\nIn most cases, steps are repeated until the evaluation determines that a change in condition has occurred. When this happens, the iteration is completed."

Adam is a version of stochastic gradient descent that includes memory terms to prevent getting stuck in local minima. SGD is a more traditional algorithm that is not as susceptible to getting stuck in minima."
