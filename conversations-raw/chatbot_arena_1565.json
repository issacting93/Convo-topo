To get better results, organizations should consider incorporating behavioral science into their procurement process. This can involve using specific tactics such as using social proof to encourage participation, framing questions to elicit more honest answers, and setting expectations to ensure satisfaction. Additionally, organizations should look for ways to streamline their process, such as leveraging technology to automate certain tasks, or setting up committees to evaluate proposals instead of relying on a single buyer."
