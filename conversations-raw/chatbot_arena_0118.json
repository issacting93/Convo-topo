The primary focus of the Scrum Master is to ensure the Scrum process is being followed and to remove any impediments that may be preventing the team from delivering a product increment. The Scrum Master also helps the team improve their process and working agreements. The Scrum Master is not the project manager and is not responsible for the product's technical aspects or content. The Scrum Master's role is to create an environment in which the Development Team can work together effectively to deliver a product increment."
