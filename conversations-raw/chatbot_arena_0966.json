      "content": "Five pounds of elephants would weigh more than one pound of air. This is because the weight of an object is determined by its mass, and the mass of five pounds of elephants is greater than the mass of one pound of air. Elephants are much larger and heavier than a pound of air, so it is not possible for five pounds of elephants to weigh the same as one pound of air."

      "content": "If it was five pounds of feathers and one pound of bricks, then the five pounds of feathers would still weigh more than the one pound of bricks. This is because the weight of an object is determined by its mass, and the mass of five pounds of feathers is greater than the mass of one pound of bricks. Feathers are much lighter and less dense than bricks, so it is not possible for five pounds of feathers to weigh the same as one pound of bricks."
