      "content": "Yes, it is possible to program Snake on a TI-82 calculator using TI-BASIC programming language. You would need to create a game loop that updates the position of the snake and checks for collisions with the walls and itself. You could also use the calculator's graphing capabilities to display the game board and the snake."

      "content": "You can keep track of the position of the snake using two lists: one for the x-coordinates of the snake's body segments and one for the y-coordinates. For example, you could create two lists, `X` and `Y`, and initialize them with the starting position of the snake's head:\n\n```\n{3,2,1}→X\n{1,1,1}→Y\n```\n\nIn this example, the snake's head is at position `(3,1)` and its body consists of two segments to its left. To move the snake, you would add a new head segment to the beginning of the `X` and `Y` lists and remove the last tail segment:\n\n```\n// Move the snake to the right\nX[1]+1→X(1)\nIf dim(X)>3\nThen\n    DelVar X(dim(X))\n    DelVar Y(dim(Y))\nEnd\n```\n\nThis will move the snake one unit to the right and remove the last tail segment if the snake's body is longer than three segments. You would repeat this process for each movement of the snake."
