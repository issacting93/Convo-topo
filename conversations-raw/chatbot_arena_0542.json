David speaks to Goliath on his behalf, thanking him for his victory and expressing his gratitude for God's protection and help during the battle. Goliath, however, is disappointed by David's response and says that he will continue to terrorize the people of Israel, and that he will continue to seek revenge against Israel. David is shocked and saddened by this outcome and confronts Goliath privately, asking him to walk away from the battle. Goliath refuses and says that he will never fight again, but David is determined to take him down and defeat him.

It is a thrilling and inspiring story that has been read and retold many times throughout history."
