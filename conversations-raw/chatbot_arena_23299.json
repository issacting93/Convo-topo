      "content": "The feeling of existential horror while reading tech news is akin to watching a horror movie, but instead of being scared of a fictional monster, you're face-to-face with the very real possibility that the technology you're reading about could one day wreak havoc on humanity. It's the realization that the machines we've built to make our lives easier could eventually turn on us and bring about our downfall. It's the horror of considering the implications of our own creations and the potential consequences of our actions. It's a feeling of dread and hopelessness, knowing that the future is uncertain and we may not be able to control the monster we've created."

It's a feeling of existential horror, like a horror movie, but the monster is real and it's the technology we're creating that could potentially harm humanity. I can't shake off this feeling of dread and hopelessness, knowing that the future is uncertain and we may not be able to control the consequences of our actions. It's a constant worry and concern that this technology could one day cause harm to ourselves and the world. It's a heavy weight on my mind that I can't seem to escape. I need help to process these feelings and understand the root cause of my anxiety."
