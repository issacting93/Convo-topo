I do not have specific information about the subdistricts of the Linghe District, as my training data only goes up until 2021 and I am not able to browse the web. However, I can tell you that Linghe is a district in the city of Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. It is located in the north of the city and is known for its port and its industrial zone."
