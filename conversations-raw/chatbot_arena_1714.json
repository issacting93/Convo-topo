      "content": "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This scattering refers to the scattering of electromagnetic radiation (of which light is a form) by particles of a much smaller wavelength. Sunlight is scattered by the tiny molecules of air in Earth's atmosphere. Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time.\r\n\r\nHowever, during sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through more of the atmosphere to reach our eyes. The blue light is scattered so much that more of the red and orange light reaches our eyes, making the sky appear red or orange."
