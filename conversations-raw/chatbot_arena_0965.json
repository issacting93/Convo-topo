      "content": "To determine the wavelength of a wave, we use the formula:\n\nwavelength = speed of light / frequency\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.\n\nConverting the frequency from kHz to Hz:\n\n340 kHz = 340,000 Hz\n\nNow, we can calculate the wavelength:\n\nwavelength = 299,792,458 m/s / 340,000 Hz = 882.33 meters\n\nTherefore, the wavelength of a wave with a frequency of 340 kHz is approximately 882.33 meters."
