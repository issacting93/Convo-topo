It is the same as the Cartesian coordinate system, which is used on Earth, but with the origin at the center of Mars. The coordinate system is based on the planet radius, which is 3,389.5 kilometers. The X-axis is parallel to Mars' equator and points away from Earth. The Y-axis points toward the Mars North Pole. The Z-axis points toward the Mars South Pole."
