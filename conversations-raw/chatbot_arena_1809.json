      "content": "Bob Dylan's worst album is a matter of personal opinion and can vary depending on the individual. That being said, some of Dylan's less critically acclaimed albums include \"Self Portrait\" (1970), \"Dylan & the Dead\" (1999), and \"Modern Times\" (2006). These albums were not as well received by critics and fans as some of Dylan's earlier releases, but they still feature some notable tracks and performances. Ultimately, the worst album of Bob Dylan's career is a subjective matter."

      "content": "The worst song on Bob Dylan's album \"Self Portrait\" is a matter of personal opinion and can vary depending on the individual. \"Self Portrait\" is a controversial album as it features covers of classic pop and folk songs, which many fans and critics felt did not fit Dylan's style and were not up to his usual standards. Some of the worst tracks on the album include \"She'll Be Comin' 'Round the Mountain\", \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\", and \"I'll Fix Your Roof\". However, it's worth noting that the album's poor reception is mainly due to the fact that it is a covers album, and not because it features any truly awful songs. Dylan's other albums are generally considered to be stronger and more consistent in terms of quality."
