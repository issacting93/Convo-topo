      "content": "To determine how many hours it takes to dry all 100 t-shirts, we need to know how long it takes to dry one t-shirt. If it takes 3 hours to dry 6 t-shirts, it would take 3 hours/6 t-shirts = 50 minutes to dry one t-shirt.\n\nSince you have a clothing line that can hold 100 t-shirts, it would take 100 t-shirts/50 minutes = 2 t-shirts to dry in 1 hour. This means it would take 2 hours to dry all 100 t-shirts."
