      "content": "MKUltra was a secret program conducted by the CIA between the 1950s and the 1970s. Its purpose was to study the effects of chemical and biological agents on humans and animals in order to develop more efficient ways of interrogation and torture.\n\nSome of the program's key subjects included \"brainwashing\", \"beauty treatments\" (causing long-term disability), \"false flag operations\" (undercover operations using fake agents as stand-ins for real agents or enemies), and \"programmable human agents\". The methods used included hypnosis, sodium pentothal, drugs, torture, and Project Chatter.\n\nThe program is now the subject of much conspiracy theorizing. Many believe that the program's true aim was to develop methods of mind control and behavior modification that could be applied to the American public (or any population) in a more subtle way than traditional imprisonment or torture."

      "content": "The CIA started the project as an extension of its earlier projects such as the Scientific American Committee and the Technical Services Staff, as well as the Army's bio-weapons programs and the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency program.\n\nThe existence of the MKUltra program was first revealed in the 1970s, during which time several internal investigations were launched. In 2005, President Gerald Ford formally apologized for the program, and in 2014 the CIA declassified a number of internal documents relating to the program."
