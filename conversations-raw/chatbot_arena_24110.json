      "content": "Technically, yes. A sentence is defined as a group of words that expresses a complete thought. The sentence \"The sky is blue today\" expresses a complete thought - that the sky is blue - without the need for punctuation.\n\nHowever, in standard written English, sentences are generally expected to end with some form of punctuation, either a period, question mark, or exclamation point. Ending a sentence without any punctuation is considered nonstandard and can make the writing appear informal.\n\nSo while \"The sky is blue today\" is a grammatically correct sentence, in most cases it would be considered better style in writing to include an ending punctuation mark, like this:\n\nThe sky is blue today.\n\nThe period at the end helps clearly indicate that the sentence has come to an end, which can aid readability and avoid confusion.\n\nSo in summary, while sentences can technically end without punctuation, in standard written English it is generally considered better style to include punctuation like periods to clearly mark the end of a sentence."
