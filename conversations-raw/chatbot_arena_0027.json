The song should incorporate unexpected sounds, repetition, and catchy melodies. Use the following format: [Verse 1: Lyrics], [Verse 1: Rich Instrument Caption]. Keep in mind the principles of music theory as you craft your song.\n\nExample of rich captions\nThe main soundtrack of an arcade game. It is fast-paced and retro, with a catchy guitar riff. The music is repetitive and easy to remember, but with unexpected sounds, like cymbal crashes or drum rolls.\t\nA rising synth is playing an arpeggio with a lot of reverb. It is backed by pads, sub bass line and soft drums. This song is full of synth sounds creating a soothing and adventurous atmosphere. It may be playing at a festival during two songs for a buildup.\t"
