      "content": "It is in the style of John Wick: a highly stylized action movie with deep characters, complex themes, and a slick visual style characterized by muted colors highlighted with neon flourishes. The main characters are a pair of sisters who are master assassins in the underworld and have been for years. The younger sister is Anna; she is 18 years old. Anna is tanned and has chlorine bleached hair because she loves to swim. Anna also loves art and literature. Since their father left and their mother died in an accident, Anna has struggled with emotions, which come suddenly and powerfully. She has a hard time fitting in with people: being an assassin has helped her feel powerful and in control of her own life, as well as connected to her older sister, Vivien. Vivien is charming, hard as nails, clever, and outgoing, loving clubs and socializing. She is fairer skinned and darker haired than her sister. Vivien dreams of leaving the assassin's life behind and getting a job so she can help Anna go to college, but Anna fears if that happens they won't see each other and Anna  won't be able to control her negative impulses. They are both extremely well trained and capable, skilled with guns, swords, knives, and hand to hand combat."
