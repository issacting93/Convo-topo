G42: Move and orient the workpiece\n\nG42 M0 Z.0 F500.0 G1 X0.0 Y0.0 G0 Z.0 E0.0\\\n\nThis code moves the workpiece to the origin (0,0,0), sets the 500mm maximum feedrate and enables the 0.0mm incremental feedrate.\n\n2. G1 X0.0 Y0.0 Z0.0 F60.0 G0 Z0.0 E0.0\\\n\nThis code moves the workpiece to the 0 coordinate of the X, Y, and Z axes, sets the feedrate to 60mm/min and disables the feedrate override.\n\n3. G0.0 Z.0.0 F2000.0 G1 X1.0 Y1.0 Z1.0 G0.0 E0.0\\\n\nThis code moves the workpiece to the 0 coordinate of the Z-axis, sets the feedrate to 2000mm/min, moves the workpiece to the coordinates of X=1mm, Y=1mm, and Z=1mm, and disables the feedrate override."

Can you please provide me with the following information:\n\n1. The maximum and minimum diameters of your workpiece.\n2. The maximum distance you want to mill (in millimeters).\n3. The material you will be milling.\n\nBased on this information, I can calculate the feedrate for your CNC mill."
