She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?"

      "content": "It's difficult to say whether it was a smart move or not without more context about the situation and your feelings. It sounds like you were hurt and angry when the woman you were involved with lied to you and treated you poorly. However, blocking her everywhere and giving up on the relationship may not be the best solution. It may be helpful to have a conversation with her about your feelings and boundaries, and to try to find a way to move forward that works for both of you. It may also be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor to help you process your emotions and make decisions about the future of the relationship."

      "content": "It's understandable that a woman in a situation like this may be afraid of how a new relationship could impact her existing love. It's important to respect her feelings and boundaries, and try to find a way to move forward that works for both of you. It may be helpful to discuss your feelings and boundaries, and to try to find a way to reconcile your love for her with her love for the other man. It may also be helpful to discuss the potential risks and benefits of continuing the relationship, and to make a decision together about what is best for both of you."
