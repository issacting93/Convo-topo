      "content": "The RMS (Root Means Square) of a distribution is a measure of the spread or dispersion of the distribution. It is defined as the square root of the mean of the squared deviations from the mean.\n\nThe mean of the deviation refers to the average value of the deviations from the mean. It is the value of the mean of the RMS.\n\nIn simple terms, the mean of the deviation is the average value of the RMS, and the RMS is the square root of the mean of the squared deviations from the mean.\n\nFor example, if you have a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10, the mean of the deviation would be 10, and the RMS would be 10."

      "content": "The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the mean of the squared deviations from the mean. The equation between the RMS and the standard deviation is:\n\nStandard Deviation (σ) = √Mean of the Squared Deviations from the Mean (MSSD)\n\nWhere:\n\n*   MSSD = Mean of the Square of the Deviations from the Mean\n*   MSSD = (Σ(x - mean)^2 / N) / (√(N))\n\nThis is the mathematical formula that relates the RMS and the standard deviation.\n\nIt's important to note that the RMS and the standard deviation are two different measures of the spread or dispersion of a distribution. The RMS measures the spread of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the variability of the distribution.\n\nFor example, if you have a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10, the RMS would be 10, and the standard deviation would be 10."
