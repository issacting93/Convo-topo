I misinterpreted the order of the information provided.\n\nLet me re-analyze this:\n\n* You have 32 apples today \n* Yesterday you had some other number of apples (which is not specified)\n* You ate 28 apples yesterday (so that was the number you had yesterday before eating them)\n* So you have 32 apples today, and you had 28 apples yesterday before eating them \n* But I don't know how many you had yesterday after eating them\n\nSo the only definitive conclusion I can make is:\n\nYou have 32 apples today.\n\nI apologize for the confusion, you're correct that I should not assume the order of the statements corresponds to the chronological order of events. I will be more careful about that in the future."
