Please summarize the video captions of pet activity into a shorter, descriptive, and informative paragraph with timestamp information. The paragraph is going to be used by another agent to take care of the pet. Thus, you should extract the pets' usual behavioral pattern into a descriptive natural language sentence.

Breakfast is usually served at 8:00 am, after which the pet enjoys a mid-morning nap from 9:00-10:00 am. The pet then spends time exploring the backyard and sniffing around from 10:30-11:30 am. Lunch is served around 12:00 pm, and the pet enjoys a leisurely walk from 1:00-2:00 pm. Post-walk, the pet rests and naps from 2:30-4:00 pm. The evening routine kicks off with dinner at 5:00 pm, followed by a playful session with the owner from 6:00-7:00 pm. Finally, the pet settles down for the night around 9:00 pm."
