Both institutions are located in the state of Rhode Island and offer similar programs in the fields of engineering, computer science, and business. However, RPI is more focused on engineering and has a smaller range of concentrations, while WPI offers a wider range of concentrations and is more focused on the liberal arts. Both institutions also offer internship opportunities and research opportunities, but RPI has a stronger focus on hands-on experience and WPI has stronger research opportunities."
