It is a tricky question, but not a trick question.\n\nYou come to a fork in the road with two paths: one leads to a castle, the other to certain doom. At this fork, there are two guards. One guard always tells the truth, and the other always lies. Each guard knows whether the other guard tells the truth or lies. You, the traveler, also know that one guard always tells the truth and the other always lies, but you don't know which guard is which, or which path leads where.\n\nYou are allowed to ask one guard a single question to find the path to the castle. What should you ask?"
