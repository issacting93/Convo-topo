It is written in a cipher called Atbash, which is a simple substitution cipher that replaces each letter with its corresponding letter 13 places down the alphabet. So, for example, \"A\" becomes \"N\", \"B\" becomes \"O\", and so on.\n\nDecrypting the sentence using Atbash gives us the following:\n\n> Hello, how are you today?\n\nSo, the sentence \"Do dn v ndhkgz nziozixz ziydib di ocz rjmy kjovoj\" is simply a scrambled version of the English sentence \"Hello, how are you today?\"."
