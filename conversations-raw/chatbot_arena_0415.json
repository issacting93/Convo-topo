However, I can tell you that ICS security is a field of study that focuses on the protection of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) from cyber threats. ICS are used to control and monitor critical infrastructures such as power plants, water treatment facilities, and transportation systems. Research in this field typically focuses on topics such as securing ICS networks, detecting and responding to cyber attacks, and developing new methods for protecting ICS from threats. Some recent topics in this field that have been researched include IoT security, SCADA and DCS security, and OT network security."
