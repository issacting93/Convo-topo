Otherwise, it should be reported to both BAFIN and the FCA.\nIf the Trade Trader Location is FFT and the Citi is LON, then the trade should be reported to both BAFIN and the FCA (RTO_BOTH). Otherwise, the trade is not considered RTO.\nThe rule that checks if a trade falls under the RTO requirement is called the \"If trade Trader Location is FFT and the Citi is not LON\" rule. This rule says that if the trade Trader Location is FFT and the Citi is not LON, then the trade must be reported to BAFIN only. When the trade Trader Location is FFT and the Citi is LON, the trade must be reported to BAFIN and the FCA (RTO_BOTH). If the trade is not met with these conditions, the trade is not considered RTO.\nOverall, the rules in this text are intended to ensure that trades fall under the RTO requirements and are properly reported to appropriate authorities."

      "content": "Under MIFID II, traders are required to report to BAFIN when they enter into transactions with non-resident entities (NREs), as well as when they enter into transactions with entities that are subject to UK laws and regulations. The specific requirements for reporting to BAFIN and the FCA depend on several factors, including:\n* The type of transaction (e.g., spot exchange transactions, derivatives transactions, swaps transactions)\n* The location of the trader (e.g., FFT or LON locations)\n* The type of account being used for the trade, such as a brokerage account or custody account\n* The details of the client involved in the transaction, such as the trader's name, contact information, and account number\n* The date of the trade (e.g., day of the week or month of the trade).\nThe timing of reporting to BAFIN and the FCA will depend on the specific circumstances of the trade. For example, if a trade involves a single electronic trade, the trade would typically be reported to BAFIN within 24 hours, while if a trade involves multiple electronic trades, the trade would typically be reported to BAFIN within 48 hours. However, if the trade involves a substantial amount of financial instruments, such as a derivative or futures contract, the trade would likely need to be reported to both BAFIN and the FCA"
