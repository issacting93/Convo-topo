Sometimes they like to play with each other by splashing around or chasing one another. Ducks are also very good at flying! They can fly over the water, and even dive into the water to escape predators. They are really amazing animals."

Did you know that their skin is so tough, even a knife can't penetrate it? And they have a really weird tongue that can taste the salt in their food while they are swimming in fresh water. Plus, they can live for over 100 years! Crocodiles are truly the kings of the jungle."
