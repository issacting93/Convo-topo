Suppose there exists an element x in A that is also in B.\n\nThen x is either equal to 1 or 2. If x is equal to 1, then 1 is in A but not in B, which contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint sets. If x is equal to 2, then 2 is in A and in B, which also contradicts the fact that A and B are disjoint sets.\n\nTherefore, our assumption that there exists an element x in A that is also in B must be false, which means that there exists an element in A that is not in B."

The additional tuition for summer classes is not necessarily a con if you are paying for the tuition anyways, as you will still be earning college credit and potentially saving time and money by finishing your degree program early.\n\nThe con I listed earlier, which was poorly phrased, was the potential inconvenience of having to pay for additional summer tuition and fees, which may not be necessary if you are already paying for the tuition for the credit. My apologies for any confusion caused."
