If you're a surfer, a swimmer, or just someone who loves spending time in the water, then you'll need a wetsuit to keep you warm and comfortable. So, let's get started!\n\n[Cut to Theo standing in front of a wetsuit]\n\nTheo: First, you'll need to choose the right size wetsuit for your body. You can find the size on the label on the wetsuit. Make sure it's not too tight or too loose, because you'll need to be able to move your arms and legs freely.\n\n[Cut to Theo putting on the wetsuit]\n\nTheo: Now, let's put on the wetsuit! First, you'll put on your feet and pull them up to your knees. Then, you'll lift the wetsuit up and put your arms into the sleeves.\n\n[Cut to Theo showing how to put on the arms]\n\nTheo: To put on the arms, you'll lift them up and pull them over your head, then slide your hands into the sleeves. You may need some help to get the arms on, so don't be afraid to ask for help.\n\n[Cut to Theo showing how to put on the legs]\n\nTheo: Now, let's put on the legs. To do this, you'll lift the wetsuit up to your waist and pull the legs on over your hips. Make sure the waistband is tight so that the wetsuit stays in place.\n\n[Cut to Theo showing how to put on the hood]\n\nTheo: If your wetsuit has a hood, you'll put it on next. To do this, you'll lift the hood up and pull it over your head, then adjust it so that it fits snugly around your face.\n\n[Outro music plays as Theo appears on screen, wearing a wetsuit and smiling]\n\nTheo: And that'"

The answer is simple: swim trunks!\n\n[Cut to Theo changing into swim trunks]\n\nTheo: Swim trunks are the best choice because they're made of a quick-drying material that won't absorb water, and they won't rub against your skin and cause chafing.\n\n[Cut to Theo putting on the wetsuit over the swim trunks]\n\nTheo: So, just put on your swim trunks and then put on your wetsuit over them. This will keep you comfortable and protected in the water.\n\n[Outro music plays as Theo appears on screen, wearing a wetsuit and smiling]\n\nTheo: And that's it! Now you know how to put on a wetsuit and what to wear underneath it. I hope you found this video helpful.

      "content": "[Theo appears on screen, holding up a pair of Speedos]\n\nTheo: Now, I know some people might be wondering why I'm wearing Speedos under my wetsuit. Well, there are a few reasons why I prefer to wear them.\n\n[Cut to Theo changing into the Speedos]\n\nTheo: For one, they're made of a quick-drying material, just like swim trunks. But they also fit much closer to your body, which means they won't rub against your skin and cause chafing.\n\n[Cut to Theo putting on the wetsuit over the Speedos]\n\nTheo: And when you're surfing or swimming, you want to have as much mobility as possible. Speedos allow you to move your legs and hips freely, which can help you paddle faster and turn more easily.\n\n[Cut to Theo demonstrating how the Speedos allow him to move his legs freely]\n\nTheo: As you can see, I can move my legs and hips much more easily in these Speedos than I can in swim trunks. So, if you want to be as comfortable and mobile as possible in the water, give Speedos a try!\n\n[Outro music plays as Theo appears on screen, wearing a wetsuit and smiling]\n\nTheo: So, there you have it.
