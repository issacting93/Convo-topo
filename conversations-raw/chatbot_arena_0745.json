      "content": "To create a simple notation for representing types of dice rolls, we can use abbreviations, numbers, and operators to clearly convey the steps needed. Here is a notation system:\n\n1. Use 'R' to represent 'roll'.\n2. Numbers preceding 'd' represent the number of dice to roll.\n3. Numbers following 'd' represent the type of dice (e.g., d6 for a six-sided die).\n4. Use 'D' followed by a number to represent 'drop' and specify the number of dice to drop.\n5. Use 'L' or 'H' after the drop command to specify if you're dropping the lowest or highest rolls.\n6. Use '+' to indicate summing the remaining dice.\n\nUsing this notation, here are some examples:\n\n1. Roll 4d6, drop the lowest, and sum the remainder: R4d6D1L+\n\nCreate additional examples of this notation and what the notation means."

This notation is more flexible, as it allows for more complex calculations and more precise notation."
