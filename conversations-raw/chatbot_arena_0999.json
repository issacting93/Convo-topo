      "content": "Let x be the number of chickens, y be the number of spiders, and z be the number of frogs.\n\nWe know that:\n1. x + y + z = 100 (Total number of animals)\n2. 2x + 8y + 4z = 794 (Total number of legs)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x, y, and z.\n\nFrom equation 1, we can write z in terms of x and y:\nz = 100 - x - y\n\nNow, substitute this expression for z in equation 2:\n2x + 8y + 4(100 - x - y) = 794\n\nSimplify and solve for y:\n2x + 8y + 400 - 4x - 4y = 794\n-2x + 4y = 394\ny = (2x + 394) / 4\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy this equation. We can use trial and error method to find the values:\n\nStarting with x = 0 (all chickens):\ny = (2*0 + 394) / 4\ny = 98.5 (not an integer, so this is not a solution)\n\nNow, we can continue trying different values for x until we find integer values for y:\n\nx = 38:\ny = (2*38 + 394) / 4\ny = 94\n\nNow we have integer values for x and y, and we can find the value of z:\nz = 100 - x - y\nz = 100 - 38 - 94\nz = -32 (not possible, since we cannot have negative number of animals)\n\nx = 74:\ny = (2*74 + 394) / 4\ny = 91\n\nNow we have integer values for x and y, and we can find the value of z:\nz = 100 - x - y\nz = 100 - 74 - 91\nz = -65 (not possible, since we cannot have negative number of animals)\n\nx = 98:\ny = (2*98 + 394) / 4\ny = 295/2 (not an integer, so this is not a solution)\n\nAfter further trial and error, we find the values:\n\nx = 34:\ny = (2*34 + 394) / 4\ny = 93/1\ny = 93\n\nNow we have integer values for x and y, and we can find the value of z:\nz = 100 - x - y\nz = 100 - 34 - 93\nz = -27 (not possible, since we cannot have negative number of animals)\n\nx = 36:\ny = (2*36 + 394) / 4\ny = 233/2 (not an integer, so this is not a solution)\n\nAfter further trial and error, we find the values:\n\nx = 14:\ny = (2*14 + 394) / 4\ny = 47\n\nNow we have integer values for x and y, and we can find the value of z:\nz = 100 - x - y\nz = 100 - 14 - 47\nz = 39\n\nTherefore, there are 14 chickens, 47 spiders, and 39 frogs."

      "content": "Now we will check if the total number of legs is 794 using the given values of x, y, and z.\n\nNumber of legs for:\nChickens (x = 14) = 2 * 14 = 28 legs\nSpiders (y = 47) = 8 * 47 = 376 legs\nFrogs (z = 39) = 4 * 39 = 156 legs\n\nTotal number of legs = 28 legs (chickens) + 376 legs (spiders) + 156 legs (frogs) = 560 legs\n\nIt seems that I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me correct it.\n\nLet's go back to the substitution step:\n2x + 8y + 4(100 - x - y) = 794\n2x + 8y + 400 - 4x - 4y = 794\n-2x + 4y = -394\n4y - 2x = 394\n\nNow, divide the whole equation by 2:\n2y - x = 197\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for x and y that satisfy this equation. We can use the trial and error method to find the values:\n\nx = 1:\n2y - 1 = 197\n2y = 198\ny = 99\n\nNow we have integer values for x and y, and we can find the value of z:\nz = 100 - x - y\nz = 100 - 1 - 99\nz = 0\n\nTherefore, there are 1 chicken, 99 spiders, and 0 frogs.\n\nNow let's check the total number of legs again:\n\nNumber of legs for:\nChickens (x = 1) = 2 * 1 = 2 legs\nSpiders (y = 99) = 8 * 99 = 792 legs\nFrogs (z = 0) = 4 * 0 = 0 legs\n\nTotal number of legs = 2 legs (chickens) + 792 legs (spiders) + 0 legs (frogs) = 794 legs\n\nNow the total number of legs is correct as per the given information. So, there are 1 chicken, 99 spiders, and 0 frogs."
