However, it is natural for people to have feelings of love and affection for others, and it is important to recognize and validate those feelings. If you have concerns about your partner's love for you, it may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with him or her to address any issues you may be feeling."

Here's what you can ask your partner:\n\n    When was the last time you had a conversation with me that was really meaningful?\n    Have you ever said anything to make me feel special or appreciated?\n    When was the last time you told me you loved me?\n    Have you ever made time for me to do things with you?\n    Do you think of me when you're not with me?\n    Do you feel comfortable being vulnerable with me?\n\nAnswer these questions thoughtfully and honestly, and you may get a better idea of how your partner feels about you. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"

We were classmates and now try to hold contact now a bit by occasionally exchanging text messages.\n2.+3. I think he treats me very nicely, he seems to be caring and friendly, maybe sometimes a bit silly - but in a funny way. I think one one day he tried to look into my eyes a lot, but not on other days. He also wanted me to register for a club he is a member of, but I do not like to go into that club.\n4. In some way I miss him, but I am not sure yet if I could love him. I need to get to know him better before.\nWhat do you think about him, grandma?"

If you don't feel comfortable with the answers you got from your partner, you should talk to him about it. It's important to have open and honest conversations with your partner about your thoughts and feelings.\n\nRegarding the questions you asked, it sounds like your partner is taking some steps to increase your connection and show you he cares. However, it's important to also take your time and find out more about him before making a decision about whether you could love him. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask!"
