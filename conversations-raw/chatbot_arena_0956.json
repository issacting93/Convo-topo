It does so by using the `sorted` function, which takes a list as an argument and returns a new list sorted in ascending order."

      "content": "If you can't use `sorted`, you can use the following function to sort a list in ascending order:\n```python\ndef sort_list(lst):\n    for i in range(len(lst)-1):\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):\n            if lst[j] < lst[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        lst[min_idx], lst[i] = lst[i], lst[min_idx]\n    return lst\n```\nThis function takes a list `lst` as an argument and returns a new list with the elements sorted in ascending order. It works by iterating through the list in reverse, comparing each element to the next element and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. It does so by using a nested loop that iterates through the list in reverse order."
