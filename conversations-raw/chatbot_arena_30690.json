Of course, C should explain B the reason why A wants to get in contact with B."

A should mention in their message to C that B should of course only contact A if B is willing to do so (or the message should at least make clear in nice words that A does not want to build preasure for contact through C). A should also ask C to share the reason for A's request: That A wants to move to B's city and has some questions about that."
