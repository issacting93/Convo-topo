      "content": "Traditional wives are often shamed in today's culture because of the changing role of women in society. Women today are often expected to have equal rights and opportunities in life, including in the workforce. In some cases, traditional gender roles and expectations can be seen as oppressive or limiting to women. This can lead to shaming of women who choose to adhere to more traditional roles."
