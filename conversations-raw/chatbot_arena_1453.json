      "content": "The humor of the joke is that it is a play on words, using a simple and straightforward phrase to make a punchline that is unexpected and clever. The shark is a character in the Bible story of Noah, and the shark decides to cross the road to get to him so it can have a closer look at him. The punchline is a satirical take on the idea of a shark and Noah not having a good relationship, and the joke is meant to be a lighthearted and easy-to-understand way of making a point."
