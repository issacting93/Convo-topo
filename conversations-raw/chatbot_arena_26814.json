You can edit this script to display different messages or perform various other tasks.\n\nHere's an example of an F5 iRule script that performs a simple redirect:\n\n\n```bash\n:SetTitleMatchMode, 2\n\n:Log \"Redirecting to <a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_new\">http://www.example.com</a>\"\n:LocalRedirect http://www.example.com\n\n```\n\nIn this example, the script sets the title match mode to match the first part of the URL, and then displays a message in the log stating that the user is being redirected to \"<a href=\"http://www.example.com\" target=\"_new\">http://www.example.com</a>\". It then performs a local redirect to the specified URL.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
