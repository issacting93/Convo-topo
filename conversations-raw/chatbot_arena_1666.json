      "content": "To decode a word that was encrypted with a Caesar cipher with a shift of 5, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.   Identify the length of the key used to encrypt the word. The key is the number by which each letter in the alphabet has been shifted. In this case, the key is 5.\n2.   First, decode the first letter of the word by subtracting 5 from its corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the first letter of the word is \"A\", then the encoded letter would be \"E\" (A - 5 = E).\n3.   Next, decode the second letter of the word by subtracting 5 from its corresponding letter in the alphabet. For example, if the second letter of the word is \"B\", then the encoded letter would be \"F\" (B - 5 = F).\n4.   Continue this process for the rest of the word, decoding each letter by subtracting 5 from its corresponding letter in the alphabet.\n5.   Once you have decoded the entire word, you can reconstruct the original word by reversing the process, shifting each letter back to its original position in the alphabet.\n\nHere is an example of how this would work:\n\nLet's say the encrypted word is \"HELLO\".\n\nStep 1: Decode the first letter of the word: \"E\" (H - 5 = E)\n\nStep 2: Decode the second letter of the word: \"F\" (L - 5 = F)\n\nStep 3: Decode the third letter of the word: \"G\" (O - 5 = G)\n\nStep 4: Decode the fourth letter of the word: \"I\" (H - 5 = I)\n\nStep 5: Decode the fifth letter of the word: \"J\" (E - 5 = J)\n\nStep 6: Decode the sixth letter of the word: \"K\" (L - 5 = K)\n\nStep 7: Decode the seventh letter of the word: \"M\" (O - 5 = M)\n\nStep 8: Decode the eighth letter of the word: \"N\" (H - 5 = N)\n\nStep 9: Decode the ninth letter of the word: \"O\""
