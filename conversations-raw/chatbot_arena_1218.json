For each divisor, it calculates the remainder of X divided by that divisor and updates the result if it is less than or equal to X. The minimum number of calculations is then calculated as the total number of iterations minus the number of values that can be calculated from X with the given divisors."

It then calculates the total weight and value of the items by iterating over the items and adding the weight and value of each one to the appropriate totals.\n\nThe minimum weight and value are then calculated as the smallest possible values that can be achieved by selecting at most `` K `` items. These values are stored in the `` min_weight `` and `` min_value `` variables, respectively.\n\nFinally, the code prints the minimum weight that can be achieved by using at most `` K `` items."
