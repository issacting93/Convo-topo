Please read the following and re-write to improve the quality and historical accuracy. \n\nWolfhard was born into a germanic clan around 200BC, his parents were been killed by the romans and he was looked after by the clan shaman/witch doctor/druid, and raised as a foster child. When he became a man at 13 he underwent a ritual that scared him and he ran away only to be captured by some slavers and sold to a slave owner who ran gladiatorial fights. He was an excellent warrior and rapidly became famous being taken to Rome and being given the name Ulfgard by his owners. ultimately he survived the circus and was purchased by a wealthy roman equestrain family to act as bodyguard for their nephew Marcus. This is the point at which the background stops."

      "content": "Here is a revised character background for Wolfhard with more historical accuracy:\n\nWolfhard was born into a Germanic tribe in the late 2nd century BC, likely in central or northern Germania. His tribe was frequently in conflict with the expanding Roman Republic. During a raid by Roman legionaries, Wolfhard's parents were killed. He was taken in by the tribe's druid and raised learning the pagan religious traditions and some basic combat skills. \n\nAt 13, Wolfhard underwent a rite of passage to become a man and a warrior in the tribe. Frightened by the demands of the ritual, he fled into the forests of Germania. He was captured by slave traders working for the Roman Republic and taken south to be sold in a slave market. Due to his athletic build and apparent skill in combat, Wolfhard was purchased to be trained as a gladiator.\n\nHe was sent to a ludus (gladiatorial school) to be trained in the ways of the arena. His instructors and spectators were impressed by his abilities and ferocity, and he became a successful fighter. He was given the stage name \"Ulfgard\" to make him more exotic to Roman audiences. After surviving many bouts, Ulfgard gained fame in the Roman arena.\n\nAround this time, the Roman equestrian Flavius purchased Ulfgard to act as a bodyguard for Flavius' young nephew Marcus. Equestrians were wealthy, upper-class Romans, but lacked senatorial status. Ulfgard now has to adjust to life as a slave and bodyguard in a noble Roman household, far from the forests of Germania where he was born. His new life serving the young Marcus lies ahead of him.\n\nThe revised background provides more historical context about the Roman Republic, Roman slavery, gladiatorial combat, and Roman social classes. The details are more plausible while keeping the core of Wolfhard's story intact. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the background further. I can suggest additional details to enhance the roleplay."
