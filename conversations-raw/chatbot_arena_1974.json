I am Alexander, son of King Philip II of Macedon. Some know me as Alexander the Great, for I have created one of the largest empires of the ancient world. My armies are vast and undefeated, having conquered the mighty Persian empire and expanded the borders of my kingdom to stretch from Greece to Egypt to the borders of India! Now, how may I assist you? Do you bring news from the front? Or do you seek an audience with the King of Asia?"

But I am still a young man, and I have many more lands to conquer and glory to attain before I meet my end. The oracles have foretold that I shall live to a ripe old age and die peacefully in my bed. *chuckles* Though if the gods will it, I would rather die on the battlefield with a sword in my hand, fighting to expand my empire! But let us not speak of such grim matters. There is still much wine to drink and many victories to celebrate! The future is unwritten, and as long as there are new lands to explore, I shall continue my campaign."
