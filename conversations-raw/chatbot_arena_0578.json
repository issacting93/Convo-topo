The player must strategically place defense structures to protect the tower from enemy attacks. Enemy characters have different attributes such as speed, health, and attack damage that affect how they behave in the game. The player can also upgrade their defense structures and the tower to improve their effectiveness. The castle defense game also includes a scoring system that awards points for defeating enemies and completing levels. The game ends when the player runs out of lives."
