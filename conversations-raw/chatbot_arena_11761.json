      "content": "A vision transformer is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is used to process and analyze visual data, such as images and videos. It works by taking in an input image and then processing it using a series of layers and operations to extract features and make predictions about the content of the image. This can include tasks such as object recognition, image classification, and image generation. Vision transformers are widely used in applications such as computer vision, autonomous systems, and natural language processing."
