      "content": "There are a few things you can try to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Check the \"Refresh\" option in the \"Window Manager\" settings:\n\nOpen the \"Window Manager\" settings by typing \"wm\" in the terminal and pressing Enter. Then, navigate to the \"Behavior\" tab. Make sure that the \"Refresh\" option is set to \"When the window is iconified\" or \"When the window is minimized\". If it is set to \"Never\", this could cause new windows to not appear until they are manually refreshed.\n\n2. Check the \"Idle\" settings in the \"Power Management\" settings:\n\nOpen the \"Power Management\" settings by typing \"power\" in the terminal and pressing Enter. Then, navigate to the \"Idle\" tab. Make sure that the \"Screen Update\" option is set to \"Automatic\" or \"Never\". If it is set to \"Several seconds\", this could cause new windows to not appear until the screen is updated.\n\n3. Check for conflicts with other window managers or desktop environments:\n\nIt's possible that another window manager or desktop environment is interfering with the behavior of your window manager. Try running \"startxfce4\" instead of just \"startx\" to start the XFCE desktop environment, or try running \"startkde\" instead of \"startx\" to start the KDE desktop environment.\n\n4. Check for conflicts with other applications:\n\nIt's possible that another application is interfering with the behavior of your window manager. Try closing all other applications and see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to try reinstalling your window manager or desktop environment."

      "content": "I apologize for the confusion. If you are using Windows OS, there are a few things you can try to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. Check the \"Refresh\" option in the \"Window Manager\" settings:\n\nIf you are using a third-party window manager such as XFCE or KDE, you may have the option to configure the \"Refresh\" behavior in the settings. Check the \"Behavior\" tab and make sure that the \"Refresh\" option is set to \"When the window is iconified\" or \"When the window is minimized\". If it is set to \"Never\", this could cause new windows to not appear until they are manually refreshed.\n\n2. Check the \"Idle\" settings in the \"Power Management\" settings:\n\nOpen the \"Power Management\" settings by pressing the \"Start\" button, right-clicking on the \"Computer\" icon, and selecting \"Properties\". Then, navigate to the \"Power Options\" tab and select \"Change plan settings\". Choose the \"High Performance\" plan and click \"Change advanced power settings\". In the \"Sleep\" settings, make sure that \"Allow the system to enter a low-power state\" is set to \"Never\". If it is set to \"Several seconds\", this could cause new windows to not appear until the screen is updated.\n\n3. Check for conflicts with other window managers or desktop environments:\n\nIt's possible that another window manager or desktop environment is interfering with the behavior of your window manager. Try running the application that creates the new windows in Safe Mode to see if the issue persists. If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, it may be caused by an application or driver that is running in the background.\n\n4. Check for conflicts with other applications:\n\nIt's possible that another application is interfering with the behavior of your window manager. Try closing all other applications and see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to try reinstalling the operating system or the application that creates the new windows."
