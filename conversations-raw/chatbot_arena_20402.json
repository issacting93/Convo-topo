To reach the Monastery, you will need to enter Petra through the city's main entrance, which is located about 800 meters from the city center. From the entrance, you will need to walk through the Siq, a narrow gorge that leads to the Monastery. The Siq is about 1.2 kilometers long and is surrounded by towering cliffs and intricate carvings.\n\nOnce you reach the end of the Siq, you will see the Monastery on your left. It is a large rock-cut temple that is located about 400 meters from the entrance to the Siq.\n\nIt is recommended that you wear comfortable shoes and bring water with you when visiting the Monastery, as the walk through the Siq can be steep and the temperature can be hot. Additionally, it is a good idea to wear sunscreen and a hat to protect yourself from the sun."

The High Place of Sacrifice is a large rock-cut platform located on a hilltop overlooking Petra.

From the Monastery, head towards the Treasury and then turn left onto the trail that leads to the High Place of Sacrifice. The trail is well-marked and takes about 45 minutes to an hour to hike.\n\nAlternatively, you can take a tour that includes a visit to the High Place of Sacrifice. Many tour companies offer guided tours of Petra that include stops at the Treasury and the High Place of Sacrifice. These tours typically include transportation to and from Petra, a knowledgeable guide, and entrance fees.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
