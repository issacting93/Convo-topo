I can set my own schedule and take classes starting at a particular time. However, I cannot move around 24 hours a day.\n\nIt's important to note that the mobility of an agent in an agent-based model is a complex problem, and the agent's specific preferences and constraints may vary. Additionally, the agent's behavior is influenced by the actions of other agents in the system, so even if I set my own schedule, I may still be influenced by the actions of other agents."
