I use natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. {In this particular instance, the task at hand is to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 8 *x + 12 = 0.}\nTo solve this equation, we need to use the quadratic formula, which is {x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a}. In this case, a = 1, b = -8, and c = 12. Plugging these values into the formula gives us x = (-(-8) ± sqrt((-8)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1). Simplifying this expression gives us x = 8 ± sqrt(64 - 48), which equals x = 8 ± 2sqrt(4). Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 8 + 2sqrt(4) and x = 8 - 2sqrt(4)."
