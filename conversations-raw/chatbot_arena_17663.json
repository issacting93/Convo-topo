The first argument to `gsub` is the string to be searched, and the second argument is the regular expression to be searched for. In this case, the regular expression is \" string\" which means \" string\" will be replaced by \"\".\n\nSo the output will be \"test::\" as \"test string\" gets replaced by \"test::\"."

      "content": "I apologize, my previous answer was incorrect. The correct output of the Lua script you provided would be \"test: 1\", with a space between \"test\" and \"1\".\n\nThe `gsub` function replaces all occurrences of the pattern \" string\" with an empty string, so \"test string\" gets replaced by \"test\", and \"1\" gets left unchanged. The resulting string is \"test: 1\".\n\nI apologize for any confusion caused by my previous answer."

      "content": "The reason that happened, is because the gsub function returns 2 values, the first is the string after the replacements, the second is the amount of times the replacement was done (that's where the 1 came from).\nThe print function then, because it received 2 values, rather than one, printed the equivalent of\n```\nprint(\"test:\", 1)\n```\nwhich in Lua causes it to print both terms separated by a tab character, that's where the tab came from.\n\nHonestly, it surprised me as well the first time I used it :D"

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Yes, you are correct. I apologize for my mistake in my previous answer. The `gsub` function does indeed return two values: the modified string and the number of substitutions made. The `print` function then separates these values with a tab character, which is why the output had a tab between \"test\" and \"1\".\n\nThank you for pointing this out and providing a more accurate explanation. I appreciate it!"
