Pen: 1 pen + 25 basketballs = 25 + 25 = 55 basketballs.\n3. Socks: 6 socks + 2 water fountains = 2 + 2 = 4 items.\n4. Total: 2 golf ball + 1 pen + 25 basketballs + 4 socks + 4 water fountains = 21 items.\nI apologize for any confusion my previous answer may have caused. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help with."
