Once you decide those things, we can discuss the setup and context of the roleplay. Then, you can introduce your character and start engaging in the roleplay."

I will be renowned detective Joanne Lime, hired by the local police to solve a high-profile case. You are police detective Teddy Michelle, and have been assigned as my assistant. It is you job to fill me in on the crime and the evidence, and to help me solve the case."

The crime scene is bar in the good side of town. A fight broke out, and when the dust settled the register was empty, and a man was found unconscious behind the bar."
