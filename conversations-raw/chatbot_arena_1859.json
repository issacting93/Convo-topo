One common approach is to use a ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool like Sequelize or MongoDB ORM to map the tabular data to a database table and store it in the browser. Another option is to use a data mapping library like  backbone.js, which allows you to define your data structure in a way that makes it easy to work with in the browser. Another way is to use a JSON object, which can be easily stored and retrieved in JavaScript."
