Jack was very curious and loved playing with his toys.\nOne day, Jack was trying to calculate 2+2*2, but he had trouble remembering the steps. He tried to remember the numbers, but they were too small to store in his small memory.\nJack was frustrated and started to lose hope. He tried to use his little memory to remember the numbers again, but they were too small to store in his memory.\nOne day, Jack saw a number that he had never seen before. It was a single-digit number that he had never seen before. He tried to remember the number, but it was too small to store in his memory.\nJack was frustrated and started to cry. He had always wanted to learn to count and memorize numbers, but his memory was too small to store them.\nOne day, Jack was sitting on his bed and was playing with a toy. He had just finished playing with a block and a ball, and he wanted to learn how to count and memorize numbers.\nJack's mother came over to help him with his math homework. She said that he had a lot to learn and that he would be very good at it if he practice"
