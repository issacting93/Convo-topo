      "content": "Here is a possible priority order for where AI will most benefit Knowledge Management:\n\n1. Knowledge Discovery and Extraction - AI can analyze vast amounts of data to discover new patterns, insights, and knowledge that humans would otherwise miss. This includes text and data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\n2. Knowledge Organization and Structure - AI can assist in organizing and structuring knowledge in databases, ontologies, and taxonomies to make it more accessible and usable. This includes semantic analysis, classification, and knowledge graph construction.\n\n3. Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination - AI can automate and improve how knowledge is shared and disseminated within organizations through tools like chatbots, virtual assistants, and recommender systems. This enables wider and faster distribution of knowledge.  \n\n4. Knowledge Capture and Curation - AI technologies like machine learning and natural language processing can assist in capturing knowledge from various sources like documents, emails, and conversations. AI can then curate and filter this knowledge for relevance.\n\n5. Knowledge Application - AI systems that have been trained on an organization's knowledge bases can apply that knowledge to tasks like answering questions, generating insights, and making recommendations. This enables knowledge to be directly applied and put into action.\n\nThose are the top 5 areas in general where I believe AI has the greatest potential to improve and augment Knowledge Management processes and capabilities within organizations. The specific priority of those areas would depend on an organization's unique needs and goals."

Capturing valuable information, organizing it and making it accessible  for employees to use effectively and productively.  \n\n2. Creating systems to identify, gather, share and leverage the collective expertise within an organization to improve performance and competitiveness.   \n\n3. Developing processes and tools to facilitate the creation, dissemination, and utilization of knowledge to enhance innovation and drive business goals.   \n\n4. Managing an organization's intellectual assets - including both explicit knowledge stored in documents and databases, as well as tacit knowledge possessed by employees.\n\n5. Utilizing people, processes and technologies to facilitate the flow of information and ideas throughout an organization so the right knowledge gets to the right people at the right time."

      "content": "Here are three ways to deal with a skeptic of Knowledge Management:\n\n1. Focus on tangible benefits. Point to concrete examples of how Knowledge Management has improved productivity, efficiency, quality, customer satisfaction, and revenue within the organization or for competitor organizations. Relate it back to the organization's bottom line.\n\n2. Start small. Don't propose a large Knowledge Management overhaul. Start with a small, focused pilot project that addresses a specific pain point or opportunity. Demonstrate quick wins to build credibility and support for broader initiatives. \n\n3. Connect it to business priorities. Show how Knowledge Management can help achieve the organization's strategic goals like innovation, growth, customer centricity, etc. Tie it into initiatives the skeptic already supports. Frame it in terms of their priorities, not just as a \"KM project.\"\n\nAdditional tips:\n\n• Ask questions to better understand their skepticism. Don't dismiss their concerns.\n\n• Provide real-world examples they can relate to from outside your industry.\n\n• Emphasize people and culture aspects, not just technology. People and processes are often more persuasive than systems alone.\n\n• Involve the skeptic early. Get their input to shape Knowledge Management initiatives in a way that addresses their concerns. With involvement comes buy-in.\n\nThe key is to have a patient, thoughtful conversation that acknowledges the skeptic's perspective while persuasively illustrating how Knowledge Management can benefit the organization if properly implemented and focused on the right priorities."
