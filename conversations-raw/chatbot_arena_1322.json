      "content": "William Sommer was an American artist who lived from 1867 to 1949. He was known for his love of animals, especially horses, and painted many works featuring them. It is believed that Sommer's love for horses stemmed from his childhood growing up on a farm in Michigan where he was surrounded by them. Additionally, horses were a common subject in art during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and Sommer may have been influenced by this trend. Whatever the reason, his passion for horses is evident in his beautiful and expressive paintings."
