      "content": "The climate of Adelaide, Australia is classified as a humid subtropical climate, with hot summers and mild winters.\n\nTemperatures in Adelaide typically range from the mid-30s to the mid-40s year-round, with hot summers and mild winters. However, the average temperature during the summer months can reach up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity, and temperatures can occasionally exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit) during the hottest hours of the day.\n\nIn the winter months, temperatures can drop as low as 0 to 5 degrees Celsius (18 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit) with low humidity. The temperature usually averages around 10 to 20 degrees Celsius (67 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit) during the day.\n\nOverall, the climate of Adelaide is considered to be semi-arid with hot summers and mild winters, with occasional extremes in temperature and humidity."

      "content": "The key drivers of the climate of Adelaide, Australia can include:\n\n1. Topography: The geography of the region, including the elevation, slope, and position of the different regions like the South, East, and West coasts, can impact the temperature and humidity of the climate.\n\n2. Climate variability: The natural climate variability in the region, like the El Nino and the Pacific Oscillation, can cause a shift in climate patterns and can lead to extreme weather events.\n\n3. Air pollutants: Air pollutants like carbon dioxide, methane, and dust can have an impact on the climate, and can cause climate-related health issues.\n\n4. Soil and water resources: The location and quality of water and soil resources like rainfall and vegetation can impact the climate.\n\n5. Human activities: Human activities like deforestation, agriculture and mining, and climate change can also affect the climate of the region."
