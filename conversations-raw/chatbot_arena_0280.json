      "content": "To detect the difference between two tables, you can use the SQL `SELECT` statement with the `INNER JOIN` clause. The resulting SQL statement will return the records that have a different value in the `id` column between the two tables. Here is an example:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM table_1 AS t1\nINNER JOIN table_2 AS t2\nON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE t2.some_column IS NOT NULL\nOR t1.some_column IS NULL;\n```\n\nIn this example, `table_1` and `table_2` are the two tables that you want to compare. The `ON` clause specifies that the rows from `table_1` are matched to rows from `table_2` based on the value of the `id` column. The `WHERE` clause filters out any rows where the values in `table_2.some_column` are not null or where the value in `table_1.some_column` is not null.\n\nThis SQL statement will return all the records from `table_1` and `table_2`, and the records will have different values in the `id` column if there is a difference between the two tables."

The function will open the image file, read its contents in bytes, and convert it to a numpy array of integers using the `fromfile` method. The resulting array will be returned as a Python object."
