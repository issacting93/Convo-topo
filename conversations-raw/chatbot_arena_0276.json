The term is often used to imply that the person is overly sensitive, politically correct, or obsessed with identity politics."

      "content": "The impact of people who self-identify as Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) on society is a topic of much debate. Some argue that SJWs have a positive impact on society by raising awareness of important social issues and advocating for marginalized groups. They may also work to promote equality and combat discrimination.\n\nOthers argue that SJWs have a negative impact on society by promoting a culture of victimhood, policing language and thought, and stifling free speech. They may also be accused of prioritizing identity politics over actual issues, and of being overly sensitive and reactive rather than proactive.\n\nUltimately, the impact of SJWs on society is likely to be complex and multifaceted. While some may see them as a necessary force for progress and change, others may view them as an obstacle to progress. It is important to consider the specific actions and behaviors of individual SJWs, rather than making blanket judgments about the entire movement."
