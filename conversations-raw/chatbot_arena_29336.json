One of the most common is the Document Scanner software, which is typically included with many flatbed scanners. This software allows you to scan documents to a variety of formats, including PDF. Additionally, there are other open-source scanning applications such as gscan2pdf and kooka that can be used."

      "content": "OCR, or Optical Character Recognition, is the process of converting scanned documents into machine-readable text. The most common way to do this is to use a software-based OCR tool. Most scanner software packages include an OCR component, but there are also standalone applications such as Tesseract which can be used. The process of OCR involves scanning the document, then feeding it into the OCR engine which will attempt to recognize the characters. Once the characters are recognized, they can be saved as text, or exported to a PDF file."
