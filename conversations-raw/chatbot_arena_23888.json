For example, there's the story of the two brothers who decided to switch places for a day, and one ended up taking a job as a janitor while the other became the CEO of a major corporation. Or the time the CEO of a software company accidentally sent an email to the entire company announcing that he was fired, only to realize later that he had accidentally hit \"reply all.\" These kinds of stories can be amusing to hear or read about."
