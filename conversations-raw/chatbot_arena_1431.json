      "content": "There are a few reasons why some people refer to 'second moons' of Earth:\n\n1. Temporary captured objects: Earth's gravity can temporarily capture asteroids and comets, which orbit Earth for a while before escaping. Examples include asteroids like 2006 RH120, which orbited Earth from June to September 2006, and comets like C/2006 OF2. These are only temporary and not permanent moons.\n\n2. Cruithne: A small asteroid called 3753 Cruithne orbits the Sun, but its path also takes it close to Earth. Its orbit around the Sun appears to \"follow\" Earth's orbit. This leads some people to incorrectly call it Earth's \"second moon\". But Cruithne does not actually orbit Earth, so most astronomers do not consider it a moon.\n\n3. Quasi-satellites: Some small asteroids like 2016 HO3 have orbits that circle the Sun, but also appear to circle Earth as they do so. Their orbits are gravitationally tied to Earth's, so they remain near Earth as they orbit the Sun together. But since they still orbit the Sun directly, most scientists don't classify them as true moons of Earth. They are \"quasi-satellites\".\n\n4. Co-orbital objects: Some objects like asteroids 2014 OL339 and 2016 WF9 have orbits that share the same path as Earth's orbit at some points. They orbit the Sun, but are gravitationally tied to Earth at times. These are also not considered permanent moons.\n\nSo in summary, most reputable sources do not recognize any permanent natural satellites of Earth other than the Moon itself. Other objects that are sometimes called 'second moons' are temporary or illusory, and not true moons in the astronomical sense. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
