      "content": "If the total for the item is $16.76 and you give them $20.00, you will receive a refund of $4.76. This is because $20.00 is the purchase price, while $16.76 is the total due (after taxes). The refund is calculated by subtracting the amount due (taxes and purchase price) from the total purchase price."
