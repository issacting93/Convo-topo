If the result is greater than the current number, the loop continues to the next iteration.\n\nAfter all the divisions, the loop subtracts the result of dividing the number by the maximum division number from the current number. The number is decremented by the result of dividing the number by the maximum division number.\n\nIf the number becomes 0, the loop breaks.\n\nFinally, the solution returns the `` min_calculations `` flag, which contains the minimum number of calculations used to solve the problem."
