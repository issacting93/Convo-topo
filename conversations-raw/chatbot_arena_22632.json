      "content": "The answer to the riddle is that the result of subtracting \"white\" from a panda is simply a panda. \"White\" is not a part of a panda's physical makeup, so there is nothing to subtract. The term \"white\" is often used to describe a color that is associated with pandas, but it does not refer to a specific part of the animal's anatomy."

      "content": "If the answer to the riddle is a different type of bear, then Panda minus white would be equal to that bear. However, it's important to note that there are many different types of bears, and some of them are not closely related to pandas. Without more information, it's not possible to determine which specific bear would be the answer to the riddle."

      "content": "The black bear is sometimes referred to as a \"white bear\" in certain contexts, such as in the phrase \"white bear problem,\" which is used in computer science to refer to a problem that is so difficult that it is equivalent to finding a \"white bear\" (i.e., a problem that does not exist). In this context, the phrase \"white bear\" is used metaphorically, and does not refer to the physical appearance of the animal.\n\nBased on this use of the term \"white bear,\" it could be argued that Panda minus white is equal to a black bear in the sense that the solution to a \"white bear problem\" is not the actual physical animal known as a white bear, but rather a metaphorical representation of the difficulty of the problem. However, it's important to note that this is a somewhat unconventional interpretation of the riddle, and may not be the intended solution."
