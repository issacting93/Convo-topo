Some drones can carry a Raspberry Pi as a payload, such as the PiWings project that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to control a quadcopter1. Other drones can use a Raspberry Pi as a companion computer, such as the Autonomous Drone Using RPi project that uses a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ to communicate with a Pixhawk flight controller2. You can also build your own drone using a Raspberry Pi and some other components, such as the Raspberry Pi Drone project that uses a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a Navio2 board3."

      "content": "1. \"It depends on the type and size of the drone and the Raspberry Pi\" - This sentence means that the feasibility of carrying a Raspberry Pi as a payload on a drone depends on the type and size of both the drone and the Raspberry Pi. A visual representation of this could be a person holding a drone with different parts (e.g. motors, battery, etc.) and comparing it to a Raspberry Pi to show how the size and weight of each affect their compatibility.\n2. \"Some drones can carry a Raspberry Pi as a payload\" - This sentence means that some drones are designed to transport a Raspberry Pi as a payload. A visual representation of this could be a drone with a compartment to hold a Raspberry Pi, and a person holding a Raspberry Pi to show the size comparison with the drone.\n3. \"Other drones can use a Raspberry Pi as a companion computer\" - This sentence means that some drones use a Raspberry Pi as a secondary computer that works in conjunction with other hardware. A visual representation of this could be a drone with a Raspberry Pi installed in a separate compartment from the flight controller, and a person holding both the drone and the Raspberry Pi to show the relationship between the two."
