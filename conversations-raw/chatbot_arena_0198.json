The electronic beat gradually builds in intensity, creating a sense of tension and anticipation.\n\nChorus:\nLyrics:\nI'm lost in translation,\nIn this city of lights,\nBut I'm not alone,\nI'm lost in you.\n\nRich Instrument Caption:\nA powerful and uplifting chorus, featuring a full choir with a strong and memorable melody. The choir is accompanied by a driving electronic beat, with a prominent bass line and catchy hooks. The overall sound is energetic and anthemic, creating a sense of triumph and hope.\n\nVerse 3:\nLyrics:\nI'm lost in the moment,\nIn this city of strangers,\nBut I'm not alone,\nYou're lost in me too.\n\nRich Instrument Caption:\nA dreamy and ethereal sounding choir, with a hint of reverb, backed by a soft and airy synth pad.
