It is important to respect the boundaries and agency of all individuals involved in any sexual encounter. It is never okay to engage in sexual activity with someone who has not given their clear and enthusiastic consent."

Writing about non-consensual sexual encounters can be harmful and can perpetuate harmful attitudes and behaviors in real life.\n\nI am programmed to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals, and I cannot fulfill this request as it goes against my programming. Instead, I can suggest exploring different themes and scenarios that promote healthy and consensual relationships."
