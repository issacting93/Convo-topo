      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In this case, both \"Its\" and \"It's\" are correct. \"Its\" is the possessive pronoun that shows ownership or possession, and \"It's\" is a contraction of \"it is\" or \"it has\". So, both are correct in this context. It depends on the context and the writer's choice which one to use."
