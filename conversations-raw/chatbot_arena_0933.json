      "content": "There are several ways to fry an egg, but one simple and delicious method is to heat a non-stick pan over medium heat, crack an egg into the pan, and cook it until the whites and yolks are cooked through. You can also use a pan coated with butter or oil, add the egg, and cook it until the whites and yolks are cooked through. Additionally, you can use a griddle or a grill pan to cook the egg."
