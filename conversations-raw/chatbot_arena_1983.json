I’m imagining we’re in a lab, and we have a 2-liter bottle of soda. We pour 2 liters of soda into a cup, and then we pour the soda from the cup back into the bottle. Now we have 2 liters of soda in the bottle, plus the 2 liters we poured from the cup into the bottle. So we have 4 liters of soda in the bottle, and that’s the 4 that we add to 2 to get 8."
