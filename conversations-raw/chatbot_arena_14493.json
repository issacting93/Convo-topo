William reads 20 books.\n\nHere are the detailed explanations:\n\n1. Susan is taller than Mary, and Mary is taller than John. Therefore, Susan is the tallest.\n\n2. Sally is sitting in the middle of John and Mary. John is on Sally's left. This means that Mary is sitting on Sally's right.\n\n3. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. Therefore, the ball costs $0.10.\n\n4. Victoria reads 5 books more than twice as many as William. If Victoria reads 35 books, then twice as many as William is 35 - 5 = 30 books. Therefore, William reads 30 / 2 = 20 books.\n\nI hope this helps!"

The ball costs $0.10.\n\n4. William reads 15 books.\n\nHere are the detailed explanations:\n\n1. Susan is taller than Mary, and Mary is taller than John. Therefore, Susan is the tallest.\n\n2. Sally is sitting in the middle of John and Mary. This means that Mary is sitting between John and Sally.\n\n3. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. Therefore, the ball costs $1.10 - $1 = $0.10.\n\n4. Victoria reads 5 books more than twice as many as William. If Victoria reads 35 books, then twice as many as William is 35 / 2 = 17.5 books. Therefore, William reads 17.5 - 5 = 12.5 books. Since we cannot have half books, William reads 15 books.\n\nI hope this is correct this time."

Where is Mary sitting?\n\n**Mary is sitting on Sally's right.**\n\nSally is sitting in the middle of John and Mary. This means that there is one person to Sally's left and one person to Sally's right. John is on Sally's left, so Mary must be sitting on Sally's right.\n\n3. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?\n\n**The ball costs $0.10.**\n\nLet x be the cost of the ball. The bat costs $1 more than the ball, so the bat costs $x + $1. Together, the bat and the ball cost $1.10, so we have the equation $x + (x + $1) = $1.10. Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get $2x + $1 = $1.10. Subtracting $1 from both sides of the equation, we get $2x = $0.10. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get $x = $0.10. Therefore, the ball costs $0.10.\n\nI hope this is correct this time. Let me know if you have any other questions."
