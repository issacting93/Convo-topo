      "content": "\"Outer Wilds\" is an open-world space exploration game developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive. In the game, you play as a space explorer who is tasked with uncovering the secrets of a mysterious solar system.\n\nThe game features a unique time loop mechanic where the player dies at the end of each loop, but is able to retain their knowledge and progress from previous loops. This allows the player to explore the solar system and its many mysteries in a non-linear way, as they uncover clues and solve puzzles that progress the story.\n\nThe game is set on a giant spaceship that orbits around a star, and features a variety of planets and moons to explore, each with their own unique environments and challenges. The game is known for its stunning visuals, innovative gameplay, and emotional story.\n\nOverall, \"Outer Wilds\" is a game that has been praised for its unique blend of exploration, puzzle-solving, and emotional storytelling, and has been a critical and commercial success since its release in 2019."

      "content": "Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Here's an example of a recursive function in Python that calculates the factorial of a number:\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\nIn this function, the base case is when `n` equals 0, in which case the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function calls itself with the argument `n-1`, which is the next value to be multiplied until it reaches the base case.\n\nFor example, if we call `factorial(5)`, the function will call itself as `factorial(4)`, then `factorial(3)`, then `factorial(2)`, and finally `factorial(1)`. At the end, it will return the product of all the numbers, which is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.\n\nRecursion is a useful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems, and can make code more concise and elegant. However, it can also be less efficient and lead to stack overflow errors if not used carefully."

      "content": "Stack overflow is a situation that occurs when a program has too many recursive function calls and the program runs out of memory to store all the call frames on the call stack. A call stack is a data structure that stores information about the current state of a program, including the current function, its arguments, and local variables.\n\nRecursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly to solve a problem. This means that each recursive call adds a new entry to the call stack, which can quickly consume all the available memory if the recursive function calls itself too many times.\n\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the program will usually terminate with an error message or crash. In some cases, the program may also display a stack trace, which is a list of function calls that were executed leading up to the error.\n\nTo avoid stack overflow errors, it's important to design recursive functions with a base case that will eventually terminate the recursion, and to ensure that the recursive function calls are well-behaved and won't cause an exponential increase in the call stack size. Programmers can also use techniques such as tail recursion optimization to help reduce the amount of memory used by recursive functions."
