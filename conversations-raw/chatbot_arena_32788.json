Carbohydrates are an important source of energy, while proteins help build and maintain muscle mass. Fats are also essential for many bodily functions, such as absorbing certain vitamins and maintaining brain health.\n\nHere's an example of a weekly meal plan that may help you achieve your goals:\n\nBreakfast:\n\nWhole grain cereal with low-fat milk or yogurt\nOatmeal with nuts and fruit\nEggs (scrambled or boiled) with whole wheat toast\nSnack:\n\nFruit and nuts\nGreek yogurt with berries\nLunch:\n\nSalad with grilled chicken or fish\nSandwich on whole wheat bread with turkey or chicken breast\nSoup with vegetables and beans\nSnack:\n\nHummus and vegetables\nCheese and whole grain crackers\nDinner:\n\nGrilled fish or chicken with vegetables\nStir-fry with vegetables and tofu or lean meat\nLentil or bean stew with whole grain rice or bread\nSnack:\n\nNuts and seeds\nYogurt with granola\n\nIt's important to stay hydrated by drinking enough water throughout the day. You can also try to incorporate more water-rich foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, and soups.\n\nRemember that everyone has different dietary needs and preferences, so you may need to adjust this plan to suit your specific requirements. It's also important to consult a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet."
