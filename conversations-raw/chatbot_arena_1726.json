Wetting the bed, becoming colorblind, and experiencing headaches could be caused by a variety of different medical conditions or other factors. It is important to have your child evaluated by a doctor or healthcare provider in order to determine the cause of these symptoms. The doctor may recommend additional testing or refer your child to a specialist if necessary."

Some potential tests that may be ordered include:\n\n* Urine tests: These can help determine if there is an infection or other underlying cause for the wetting the bed.\n* Vision tests: An eye exam can determine if your child is experiencing vision problems or colorblindness.\n* Blood tests: These can help rule out or identify potential medical conditions that may be causing your child's symptoms.\n* Imaging tests: Depending on the suspected cause of your child's symptoms, imaging tests such as an MRI or CT scan may be ordered.\n* Electroencephalogram (EEG): This test can help diagnose seizures or other neurological conditions.\n\nYour child's doctor will be able to recommend the appropriate tests based on their symptoms and medical history. It is important to follow the recommendations of your child's doctor and seek medical advice as needed."
