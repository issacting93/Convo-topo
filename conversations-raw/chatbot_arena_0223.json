      "content": "If you cast a Lightning Bolt targeting a Llanowar Elves in a multiplayer game of Magic: The Gathering, the spell will resolve and deal 3 damage to the creature. However, the creature will not be removed from the game immediately. Instead, it will remain on the battlefield and be able to continue playing until the end of the turn. This means that the Llanowar Elves will be able to use its abilities and move around the battlefield during the turn after the Lightning Bolt is cast. Additionally, if the creature has any loyalty abilities, they will still be applied after the damage is dealt."
