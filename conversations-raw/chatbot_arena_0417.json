      "content": "Baize is a type of woolen cloth that is commonly used for tablecloths and other household textiles. It is made from a blend of wool and cotton, or sometimes other fibers, and is known for its durability and ability to withstand heavy use. Baize is often used for tablecloths because it is able to resist spills and stains, and it can be easily cleaned. It is also a good choice for other textiles that will be subjected to heavy wear and tear, such as place mats, aprons, and upholstery."
