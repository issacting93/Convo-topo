In contrast, the term \\\"security climate\\\" refers to the overall atmosphere or atmosphere of an organization that affects the willingness and ability of employees to comply with tax laws and regulations. Therefore, the word \\\"climate\\\" does not belong in the list of words related to tax information security."
