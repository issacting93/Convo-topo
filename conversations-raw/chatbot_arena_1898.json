In your previous question, the word \"...\" was used to indicate that the sum of 1 + 2 + ... + 4 is 10, where \"...\" represents the remaining terms in the sequence.\n\nIn this context, \"...\" is used as a placeholder for the remaining terms in the sequence, rather than as a specific number. The number 10 represents the value of the sum of the first four terms in the sequence, and \"...\" is used to indicate that the sum of the remaining terms is the same as the value of the first four terms."
