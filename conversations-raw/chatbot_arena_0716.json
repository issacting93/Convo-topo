Check your pockets, purse, or wallet.\n2. Look on common surfaces like tables, countertops, and nightstands.\n3. Retrace your steps from the last time you had them.\n4. Check around the entrance of your home or near the door.\n5. Look in the laundry basket or near the washing machine.\n6. Search in couch cushions or under furniture.\n7. Check your car if you have a spare key, they might be inside or nearby.\n8. Look in less obvious places, like the bathroom or kitchen.\n\nIf you still cannot find your keys, consider getting a key finder device or using a smartphone app to help locate them in the future."
