      "content": "If you want to take a leave at your workplace, you should first ask your manager for the leave. You can do this by sending an email or going to their desk and asking them. You will need to give them some justification as to why you need the leave and also how long you will need the leave for. You will probably need to give them approximately one month's notice. Your manager can then submit this request to your human resources department for approval. Your human resources department will review your request and if it is approved, the leave will be granted and you will get a notification. You will then need to use any accrued leave, if any, and refill your leave account before you start the leave."

In this case, you should email the human resources department and let them know about your request. Also, be aware that the leave will be granted at the discretion of the company's HR and the company may request some sort of proof of the leave being needed."
