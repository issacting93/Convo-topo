      "content": "Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:\n* The wallet costs $100\n* Betty currently has half of $100, so she has $50 \n* Betty's parents gave her $15\n* Betty's grandparents gave her twice as much as her parents, so they gave her 2 * $15 = $30\n* The total money Betty has now is:\n   - The $50 she initially had\n   - The $15 from her parents\n   - The $30 from her grandparents\n   - Total = $50 + $15 + $30 = $95\n* Since the wallet costs $100 and Betty has $95, she needs $100 - $95 = $5 more to buy the wallet.\n\nSo the conclusion is that Betty needs $5 more money to buy the wallet."

      "content": "Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?"

      "content": "Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:\n* Ken started with an empty box weighing 2 pounds\n* He then added jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds. So now the box weighs 2 pounds. \n* He then added brownies to triple the weight. Tripling 2 pounds gives 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. So now the box weighs 6 pounds.\n* He then added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So the weight is now 6 + 2 = 8 pounds.\n* Finally, he added gummy worms to double the weight. Doubling 8 pounds gives 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.\n* Therefore, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.\n\nSo in summary, the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds, is 16 pounds."
