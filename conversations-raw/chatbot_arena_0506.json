Fill the bowl with glue and mix the glitter materials with the glue.\n2. Dip a spoon into the bowl of glue and add the glitter materials to the bowl.\n3. Pour boiling water into the bowl and stir the glitter materials with the spoon until they are completely combined.\n4. Carefully drop the spoon into the boiling water and stir it with the spoon until the glitter materials are fully combined.\n5. Once the spoon is fully submerged, repeat the process with a new spoon and fresh glitter materials.\n6. Once you have completed the first batch of glitter bombs, repeat the process for as many as you need.\n7. Once you have made all the glitter bombs, carefully place the spoon back into the bowl of glue and let the glue harden.\n8. Cut the spoon into small pieces and tape them together using a piece of tape.\n9. Place the small pieces of glue-coated spoon back into the bowl of glue and let the glue dry.\n10. Once the glue has completely dried, you can remove the spoon pieces from the glue with a pair of scissors.\n11.
