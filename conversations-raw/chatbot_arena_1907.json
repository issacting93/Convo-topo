The seventh term is found by adding the common difference to the sixth term, which is 6 + 1 = 7.\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at it is that the sequence is made up of all the odd numbers from 1 to 10. The next odd number after 6 is 7."

The seventh term is found by adding the common difference to the sixth term, which is 7 + 1 = 8. However, since the sequence is alternating, the eighth term is actually 7.\r\n\r\nAnother way to look at it is that the sequence is made up of the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, and 7.
