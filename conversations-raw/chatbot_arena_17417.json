      "content": "It is a humorous and simple play on words, likely inspired by the popular TV series, \"Everybody Loves Raymond.\" The play on words is the extension of the joke's punchline, which is a play on the idea that people often use physical objects to avoid the rain rather than a zebra, as if they were a horse or an umbrella. The humor comes from the unexpected juxtaposition between the expected and the unexpected, and the play on words between the literal meaning of the two."
