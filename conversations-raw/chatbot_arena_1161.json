      "content": "I need help creating a python package with my team. We need to be able to compute geometric properties of geometric primitives that constitute a computational grid, and we also need to have access to topological information as e.g. the faces that make up the boundary of a geometric primitive. In particular, we want to support the following geometric primitives: segments, triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra. We want to represent each of these geometries by a separate class, which should\n- expose the dimensionality of the geometry and the space dimension it is embedded in (for instance, a triangle in 3d space has a dimension of 2 while the space dimension is 3)\n- expose its length (1D) / area (2D) / volume (3D)\n- provide access to its corner points\n- provide access to its faces, where each face exposes\n    - its unit outer normal vector\n    - the (primitive-)local indices of the corners that make up the face\n\nFinally, a generic geometry interface (& implementation) should be developed behind which any of the above geometries can be represented.\nThis allows users of the package to write generic code that uses geometric primitives without having to know the exact geometry types.\n\nCan you please help by providing the basic structure of such a package without implementing the specific functions and implementation details?"

The package should include classes for each of the following geometries: segments, triangles, quadrilaterals, and tetrahedra.
