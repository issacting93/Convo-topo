      "content": "What are the main findings of this paper: \"The success of neural networks on a diverse\nset of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much these networks actually “know”\nabout natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing,\na researcher chooses a linguistic task and\ntrains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network’s\nlearned representations. If the probe does\nwell, the researcher may conclude that the\nrepresentations encode knowledge related to\nthe task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the\nlogic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received\nwisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is\nmore complex, since it will result in a tighter\nestimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property\nand BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten\ntypologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research—plus English—\ntotalling eleven languages. Our implementation is available in https://github.com/\nrycolab/info-theoretic-probing.\""
