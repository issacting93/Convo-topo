IrfanView is a lightweight and fast image viewer and editor that supports a wide range of formats. Here are three useful applications that can be achieved by combining AutoHotkey and IrfanView:\n\n1. Batch image editing: With AutoHotkey, you can create scripts to automate repetitive image editing tasks in IrfanView. For example, you can write a script that renames a group of files, converts them to a specific format, and applies a set of filters to each image. This can save a lot of time for photographers, graphic designers, and other professionals who work with large numbers of images.\n2. Screen capture and editing: AutoHotkey can be used to create custom keyboard shortcuts for capturing screenshots with IrfanView. Once the screenshot is captured, you can use IrfanView's built-in editing tools to crop, resize, or annotate the image. This can be especially useful for creating tutorials, documentation, or social media content.\n3. Image slideshow and presentation: AutoHotkey can be used to create custom scripts for controlling IrfanView's slideshow and presentation modes. For example, you can write a script that automatically plays a slideshow of images in a specific folder, with a specific transition effect and time interval. This can be useful for creating digital signage, presentations, or exhibitions.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many applications that can be achieved with AutoHotkey and IrfanView. The possibilities are endless, and the best way to learn is by experimenting with the tools and exploring the many online resources available for both programs."

      "content": "Sure! Here's an example of how to use AutoHotkey and IrfanView for batch image editing:\n\nLet's say you have a folder with a hundred images that you need to resize, add a border, and save as a different file format. You can use AutoHotkey to automate this process in IrfanView with just a few lines of code:\n\nsql\nCopy code\n; Set the path to the folder containing the images\nImagePath := \"C:\\Images\"\n\n; Set the target file format and quality\nFormat := \"JPG\"\nQuality := 80\n\n; Set the target image dimensions and border size\nWidth := 800\nHeight := 600\nBorderSize := 10\n\n; Loop through each file in the folder and apply the editing\nLoop, %ImagePath%\\*.jpg\n{\n    ; Get the filename and extension of the current file\n    SplitPath, A_LoopFileFullPath, FileName, Extension\n\n    ; Open the image in IrfanView\n    Run, \"C:\\Program Files\\IrfanView\\i_view64.exe\" \"%A_LoopFileFullPath%\"\n\n    ; Resize the image\n    WinWaitActive, %FileName% - IrfanView\n    Send, ^r\n    WinWaitActive, Resize/Resample\n    Send, %Width% x %Height%\n    Send, {Enter}\n\n    ; Add a border\n    WinWaitActive, %FileName% - IrfanView\n    Send, ^b\n    WinWaitActive, Add border\n    Send, %BorderSize%\n    Send, {Enter}\n\n    ; Save the edited image\n    WinWaitActive, %FileName% - IrfanView\n    Send, ^s\n    WinWaitActive, Save as\n    Send, %ImagePath%\\%FileName%.%Format%\n    Send, {Enter}\n    Send, {Enter}\n\n    ; Close the image\n    WinWaitActive, %FileName% - IrfanView\n    Send, ^q\n}\n\n; Display a message when the editing is complete\nMsgBox, % \"Batch editing is complete!\"\nThis code uses a loop to go through each image in the folder and perform the editing steps one by one. It opens each image in IrfanView, resizes it, adds a border, and saves it as a JPG file with the specified dimensions and quality. Once all the images are processed, a message box is displayed to notify you that the batch editing is complete.\n\nOf course, this is just one example, and you can customize the code to suit your specific needs. With AutoHotkey and IrfanView, the possibilities for batch image editing are endless!"

      "content": "Sure! Here's an example of how to create a simple script in AutoHotkey to automate batch image editing with IrfanView:\n\nOpen Notepad or any other plain text editor.\nCopy and paste the following code into the editor:\n\n#NoEnv\nSendMode Input\nSetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%\n\n; Define the input and output folders\nInputFolder = C:\\input\\folder\nOutputFolder = C:\\output\\folder\n\n; Set the IrfanView command-line parameters for batch conversion and filtering\nIrfanViewPath = C:\\Program Files\\IrfanView\\i_view64.exe\nConversionParams = /convert=%OutputFolder%\\*.jpg /jpgq=90 /autoresize=(1280,960)\nFilterParams = /advancedbatch /filepattern=*.jpg /autoadjust=0 /jpgq=90 /enhancergb=(40,0,60,20,0,40)\n\n; Convert the images to the output folder and apply the filter\nRun, %IrfanViewPath% %InputFolder%\\*.jpg %ConversionParams%\nRun, %IrfanViewPath% %OutputFolder%\\*.jpg %FilterParams%\n\nModify the InputFolder and OutputFolder variables to match the location of your input and output folders.\nSave the file with a .ahk extension, for example batch_editing.ahk.\nDouble-click on the script file to run it.\nThe script will launch IrfanView and convert all the JPEG images in the input folder to the output folder, with a resolution of 1280x960 and a JPEG quality of 90. It will then apply a custom filter to the output images to enhance their colors.\nNote that this is just a simple example, and there are many more ways to customize the script to your needs. For example, you can add more parameters to the ConversionParams and FilterParams variables to adjust the output format, resolution, and color balance. You can also use IrfanView's built-in batch processing tools to apply more complex filters and transformations to the images."

IrfanView is an image viewer and editor that offers a variety of features for manipulating and managing images. Here are three useful applications that can be achieved using both AutoHotkey and IrfanView:\n\nBatch image processing: AutoHotkey can be used to automate the process of opening and manipulating multiple images in IrfanView. For example, you could write a script that opens a folder of images and resizes, crops, or applies a filter to each image in the folder, all with a few keystrokes.\n\nHotkey-based image manipulation: AutoHotkey can be used to set up custom hotkeys for frequently used IrfanView functions, such as rotate, crop, or resize. This can save time and make the image editing process more efficient.\n\nSlide show creation: IrfanView offers a variety of features for creating slide shows, and AutoHotkey can be used to automate the process of creating a slide show from a folder of images. For example, you could write a script that opens a folder of images, creates a new slide show in IrfanView, and adds the images to the slide show, all with a few keystrokes."

When the user clicks the \"Start Slideshow\" button, the script will launch Windows Photo Viewer in full-screen mode and display each image for 5 seconds. You can adjust the time each image is displayed by changing the value of the `Sleep` command.\n\nNote that this script assumes that the images are in the same folder as the script.
