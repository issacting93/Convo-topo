Apply a generous amount of food-grade mineral oil or beeswax to the surface of the board.\n3. Use a clean cloth to spread the oil or wax evenly over the surface of the board.\n4. Let the oil or wax soak into the board for a few hours or overnight.\n5. Wipe off any excess oil or wax with a clean cloth.\n6. Repeat the process every few months or as needed to keep the board well-oiled and protected.\n\nNote: Never use vegetable oil or other cooking oils to season a cutting board, as they can turn rancid and create an unpleasant odor."

      "content": "Coconut oil can be used to season a wood cutting board, but it may not be the best choice. While coconut oil is a food-grade oil that is safe to use on cutting boards, it has a lower smoke point than other oils like mineral oil and may go rancid more quickly. \n\nIf you choose to use coconut oil for seasoning your wood cutting board, it's important to use a high-quality, pure coconut oil without any additives. Also, keep in mind that coconut oil is a solid at room temperature, so you may need to warm it up slightly to make it easier to apply. \n\nOverall, it's recommended to use food-grade mineral oil or beeswax to season your cutting board, as they are more stable and will provide better protection."
