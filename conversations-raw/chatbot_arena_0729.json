The program first sorts the list using the `sort()` method. Then, it finds the middle index of the list using integer division (`//`). If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle two elements. Finally, the program prints the median value to the console."

Here is an example program in Perl to find the median of a set of numbers:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/perl\n\nuse strict;\nuse warnings;\n\nmy @numbers = (5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 1, 4, 7, 6);\n\n# First, sort the list of numbers\n@numbers = sort {$a <=> $b} @numbers;\n\n# Find the middle index of the list\nmy $middle_index = int(@numbers / 2);\n\n# If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element\nmy $median;\nif (@numbers % 2 == 1) {\n    $median = $numbers[$middle_index];\n}\n\n# If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle two elements\nelse {\n    $median = ($numbers[$middle_index - 1] + $numbers[$middle_index]) / 2;\n}\n\nprint \"The median is: $median\\n\";\n```\n\nIn this example, the list of numbers is `(5, 2, 8, 3, 9, 1, 4, 7, 6)`. The program first sorts the list using the `sort()` function with a custom comparison operator `{$a <=> $b}` that sorts the numbers in ascending order. Then, it finds the middle index of the list by dividing the length of the list by 2 and rounding down using the `int()` function. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is simply the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the middle two elements. Finally, the program prints the median value to the console using `print()`."
