(meaning I'm looking forward to the weekend)\n\n- Roll on summer, I can't wait for the warm weather. (meaning summer is eagerly wished for or anticipated)\n\nSo when someone says 'roll on 2' or 'roll on' followed by some date or event, it expresses excitement, anticipation or eagerness for that thing to happen or arrive."

      "content": "Ah I see, without more context it's hard to say exactly what 'Warden' meant by 'roll on 2'. It could be:\n\n1. Anticipating something happening on the 2nd of the month. For example, if today is January 30th, 'roll on 2' could mean eagerly waiting for February 2nd. \n\n2. Referring to a time, like 2 o'clock. For example, 'roll on 2' might mean eagerly waiting until 2pm for some event.\n\n3. Referring to a date, like the 2nd of some month. For example, 'roll on 2' could mean eagerly anticipating February 2nd or March 2nd, etc.\n\n4. Referring to a countdown of some kind. Like if there's an event happening in 2 days or 2 weeks, 'roll on 2' would express eagerness for that amount of time to pass.\n\n5. Something specific to 'Warden' and their particular situation or context. Without understanding the context around Warden saying 'roll on 2', it's hard to determine the precise meaning.\n\nSo in summary, it likely means Warden is eagerly anticipating something associated with the number 2, whether that's a date, time, countdown or something else. But the exact meaning would depend a lot on the context.\n\nDoes this help explain the possibilities? Let me know if you have any other details that could help determine what Warden meant."

Let me know if you have any other questions!"
