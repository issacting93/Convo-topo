      "content": "The sentence \"I would come home\" is in the past subjunctive form, it is used to express a hypothetical or uncertain situation. It is different from the other forms because it uses the past subjunctive form of the verb \"come\".\nIt is used to express an action that may or may not have happened in the past, depending on the circumstances or conditions.\nIt is different from \"I am coming home\" and \"I came home\" which are in the simple present or simple past form, and express actions that are certain or have already happened.\n\nSo, the main difference between \"I would come home\" and \"I am coming home\" or \"I came home\" is the time frame in which the action is taking place and the way it is expressed. \"I would come home\" is in the past subjunctive, while \"I am coming home\" and \"I came home\" are in the simple past or simple present form."
