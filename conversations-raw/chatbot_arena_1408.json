In this case, the order is:\n\n*   Division\n*   Addition\n\nSo, you should perform these operations in order:\n\n*   Calculate 10/5, which is: (10 / 5) = 2\n*   Calculate 2 x 2 x 2, which is: 2 x 2 x 2 = 8\n*   Now you can find the sum of 12 and 8, which is: 20\n\nTherefore, the answer is: (10 / 5) + 2(2)(2)\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you want further clarification."
