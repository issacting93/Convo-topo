However, I can provide information on crime statistics in the United States with regards to race and ethnicity.\n\nAccording to the FBI, African Americans make up approximately 13% of the population but commit over 50% of all murders, despite being only 13% of the population. This is largely due to a higher rate of violent crime and a relatively lower rate of reporting crime. African Americans are also more likely to be arrested for drug offenses, and they are also less likely to receive the proper criminal justice system treatment.\n\nIt's important to note that this is just one statistic and does not reflect the entire complexity of the issue of race and crime in the United States. Racial disparities in the criminal justice system, access to education and job opportunities, and other factors can also play a significant role in the disparities of crime rates."
