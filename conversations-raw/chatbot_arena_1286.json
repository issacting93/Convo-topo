      "content": "Flask and Django are both web frameworks, but they have different focuses and design philosophies. Flask is a micro web framework that is lightweight and easy to learn, while Django is a larger framework with a more complex architecture. Flask is more flexible and customizable, while Django is more structured and opinionated. Flask is often used for building single-page applications and simple APIs, while Django is better suited for building complex web applications with multiple models and database interactions. Ultimately, the choice between Flask and Django depends on the specific needs of the project and the developer's preferences."

Create a model for tasks, with fields like task name, description, status, and client.\n3. Create a model for clients, with fields like client name and client contact information.\n4. Create a many-to-many relationship between tasks and clients in the \"tasks_clients\" table, using a ManyToManyField in your model.\n5. Create a form for creating a new task, which includes fields for the task name and description, as well as a many-to-many field to associate it with a client.\n6. Create a view for displaying a list of tasks, with a form for adding new tasks and a table displaying the task details.\n7. Create a view for adding a new client, with fields for the client name and client contact information.\n8. Create a view for adding a new task, which includes fields for the task name, description, status, and client, as well as a ManyToManyField for associating the task with a client.\n9. Create a view for showing a specific task, which displays the task details and links to the task form for adding new tasks.\n10. Create a view for showing a specific client, which displays the client details and client contact information.\n11.

Create a template for showing a specific task, which displays the task details and a ManyToManyField for associating it with a client.\n15. Create a view for updating a specific task, which updates the task details and associates it with a new client.\n16. Create a view for updating a specific client, which updates the client details and associates it with a new task.\n17. Create a view for deleting a task, which deletes the task and associated client.\n18. Create a view for deleting a client, which deletes the client and associated tasks.\n19. Create a"
