Upon closer inspection, the word 'utilitarianism' actually has 7 syllables, not 5 as I had originally stated.\n\nThe correct syllable breakdown of 'utilitarianism' is:\n\nu/ti/li/ta/ri/an/ism\n\nu-ti = 2 syllables  \nli-ta = 2 syllables  \nri-an = 2 syllables\nism = 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllables = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 syllables\n\nThank you for catching my error and helping me provide accurate information. I appreciate you setting the record straight and helping me improve."
