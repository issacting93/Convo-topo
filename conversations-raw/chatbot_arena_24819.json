      "content": "The authorized signers for a company can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the laws applicable to the company. In general, authorized signers are individuals or teams who have been designated to sign legal documents on behalf of the company. These signers may be employees, contractors, or third-party agents who have been hired to perform specific tasks or services for the company.\n\nFor example, an employee of a company may be authorized to sign certain contracts or agreements on behalf of the company, while a contractor working for the company may be authorized to sign more complex documents or agreements. Additionally, third-party agents such as legal counsel or accounting firms may be authorized to sign legal documents on behalf of the company.\n\nUltimately, the decision of who is authorized to sign on behalf of a company should be made in accordance with the company's policies and the laws applicable to the company."

      "content": "The amount of GBP that a general company may require special approval to spend can vary depending on a number of factors, including the company's financial health, the type of investment, and the laws and regulations in the country where the company is located.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, companies are generally required to obtain government approval before investing more than £5,000 in a specific purpose, such as buying a new computer or hiring a new employee. This is known as the \"Financial Conduct Authority\" (FCA) restrictions. The FCA requires companies to explain how the investment will be used and whether it will generate a profit.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to these restrictions. For example, companies can spend up to £10,000 on certain types of legal or professional services without obtaining special approval. Additionally, companies can spend up to £10,000 on certain types of advertising or promotional activities without obtaining special approval.\n\nIt's worth noting that these restrictions may vary depending on the specific circumstances of a company's investment. If you are planning to make a significant investment in the United Kingdom, it's a good idea to check with the FCA to ensure that you are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."
