From there, you can choose a side and fill up on the remaining items. If for some reason you are unable to open the bread package, you can always use jam to start your day."

      "content": "A clever solution to this problem could be to open a can of tuna and start your day with a can of corned beef hash. This would contain enough protein to satisfy your hunger, as well as a few vegetables to help you start your day right. Another option could be to open a can of white toast and start your day with a small bowl of porridge or a piece of fruit. This type of breakfast can also help keep you energized as it provides carbohydrates and protein to start your day."
