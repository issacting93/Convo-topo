It is important to start training at least three months before the race, gradually increasing the distance and intensity of your runs. You should also focus on strength and mobility training, as well as stretching and foam rolling. Additionally, make sure to stay hydrated and fuel up with healthy snacks and meals throughout the day."

It is important to gradually build up your mileage, allowing your body to adapt to the stress of running and preparing for the race."
