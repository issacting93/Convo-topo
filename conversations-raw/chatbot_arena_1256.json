Add the cooked noodles to the pan, along with the soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, and sesame oil (if using). Toss everything together to ensure the noodles and vegetables are evenly coated with the sauces.\n\n8. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n9. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, or until the noodles are heated through and have absorbed the flavors of the sauce.\n\n10. Transfer the fried noodles to a serving plate, garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro, and serve immediately.\n\nFeel free to adjust the recipe according to your preferences, adding your favorite vegetables, proteins, or sauces.
