Count the characters in the encrypted word\n3. Multiply the number of characters by the shift amount (in this case, 21)\n4. Compare the resulting number to the characters in the alphabet\n5. The letter which is that number of letters after the alphabet is the decoded word.\n\nFor example, if the encrypted word was \"XLIQPVJG*KP*VJG\", the decoded word would be \"THIS\"."
