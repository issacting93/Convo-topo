Let me try to help you with the calculation again.\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for x:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\nIn our case, a = 1, b = -8, and c = 12.\nx = (-(-8) ± √((-8)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1)\nx = (-8 ± √(64 - 96)) / 2\nx = (-8 ± √92) / 2\nNow, we need to find the values of the square root of -92:\n√92 = √((-8)(-8)) = √(64) = 8\nSo, the solution to the equation x^2 - 8 *x + 12 = 0 is x = -3.\nI apologize for the mistake in my previous response.
