      "content": "The quote is from the movie \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" and is a reference to a scene where King Arthur is riding a horse and is suddenly attacked by a group of knights who are riding bananas. The knights use their bananas to knock Arthur off his horse, and he falls to the ground, landing on his back. The scene is a humorous reference to the idea of acceleration being similar to riding a banana horse."
