      "content": "The order of operations is a set of rules that specify the sequence in which calculations should be performed. It is often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). The order of operations is as follows:\n\n1. PEMDAS\n2. multiplication and division (from left to right)\n3. addition and subtraction (from left to right)\n\nThe first step is to perform anyParentheses or Exponents before moving on to the multiplication or division. The second step is to perform the multiplication or division from left to right. Finally, the third step is to perform the addition or subtraction from left to right.\n\nThis order of operations is commonly used in mathematics and other fields, and it is important to follow it in order to ensure that calculations are correct. If you are unsure about the order of operations, you may want to consult with a teacher, mentor, or a guide to ensure that you are doing it correctly."
