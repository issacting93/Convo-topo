This property defines the percentage of the text that will be displayed based on the user's browser window size.\nHere's an example of how you can use the`font-size`property to change the color of a text:```css\n!DOCTYPE html><html><head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<title>My Text</title>\n<style>\n font-size: font-size;\n margin-bottom: auto;}\n<body>\n <h1>My Text</h1>\n <p>This is my text.</p>\n</body></html>```In this example, the`font-size`property is set to`font-size: font-size;`, which determines the percentage of the text that will be displayed based on the user's browser window size. We then use a percentage value to change the color of the text.\nTo use this property in your CSS, simply add it to your text element:```css\n!DOCTYPE html><head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<title>My Text</title>```In this example, the`font-size`property is set to`font-size: font-size;`, which determines the percentage of the text that will be displayed based on the user's browser window"

      "content": "You are correct that the solution I provided is not dynamic. If the user zooms out and the browser window size returns to its default size, the font-size property will continue to change the color of the text as it grows larger.\nIf you want to change the color of text dynamically based on the user's browser window size, you can use the`font-size`property in conjunction with a script that updates the font size dynamically based on the user's browser window size.\nHere's an example of how you can use the`font-size`property to change the color of a text:```css\n!DOCTYPE html><html><head>\nmeta charset=\"UTF-8\">\ntitle>My Text</title>\nstyle>\nfont-size: font-size;\nmargin-bottom: auto;}\nbody>\n<h1>My Text</h1>\n<p>This is my text.</p>\n/body></html>```In this example, the`font-size`property is set to`font-size: font-size;`, which determines the percentage of the text that will be displayed based on the user's browser window size.
