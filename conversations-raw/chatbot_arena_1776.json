      "content": "I chose HS code 610822 for the product \"YOURS Curve Grey Floral Print Cuffed Pyjama Bottoms\" based on the following:\n\n- HS code 61 refers to \"Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, knitted or crocheted\"\n- HS code 6108 refers to \"Women's or girls' slips, petticoats, briefs, panties, nightdresses, pajamas, negligees, bathrobes, dressing gowns and similar articles, knitted or crocheted\"\n- HS code 610822 specifically refers to \"Women's or girls' pajamas and nightdresses, knitted or crocheted, of cotton\"\n\nSince the product description mentions \"pyjama bottoms\" and \"cuffed\", it indicates it is a knitted or crocheted cotton nightwear/loungewear for women, hence HS code 610822 would be most appropriate.\n\nThe HS code system is based on the description, material composition, and intended use of the products. So I analyzed these attributes of the given product to determine the most suitable HS code for it."
