      "content": "Sure, I can expand on point 3 to make it more horror-style and cosmic-style. Here's an idea for an indie game made in Java that fits those descriptions:\n\n1. A psychological horror game set in space, with the player controlling a crew member on a long-duration space mission. The gameplay could involve exploring the ship, solving puzzles to uncover the truth about what's happening on board, and surviving encounters with various horrors that lurk in the ship's dark corners.\n2. The game could feature a mix of horror and science fiction elements, with the ship's systems malfunctioning and the crew members experiencing strange and terrifying events. The player would need to use their wits and problem-solving skills to survive, while also unraveling the mystery of what's happening on board.\n3. The game could also incorporate elements of cosmic horror, with the player encountering Lovecraftian creatures and other unspeakable horrors from beyond the stars. The game's atmosphere could be tense and unsettling, with a sense of impending doom hanging over the player at all times.\n\nOverall, this game would offer a unique blend of horror and science fiction, with a focus on exploration, puzzle-solving, and survival. The game's cosmic setting would add to the sense of dread and isolation, while the player's exploration of the ship would provide a sense of claustrophobia and tension.\n\nI hope this idea gives you some inspiration for your indie game made in Java!
