For example, if your grandmother has a brother named John who has 4 siblings (born 1-3, 5-7, 9-11, and 13-15), John would have 2 siblings, and your grandmother would have 1 sibling each. The sum of their birth numbers would be 5, which would be the total number of children that your grandmother would have if you had 2 siblings."
