      "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help you with these math problems! Here are the answers:\n\n1. 3x - 4 = 8\n\nTo solve this equation, you need to isolate the variable \"x\" on one side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation, like this:\n\n3x - 4 = 8\n\n3x = 12\n\nx = 12 / 3\n\nx = 4\n\nSo the solution to the equation 3x - 4 = 8 is x = 4.\n\n2. x + 2 = 5\n\nTo solve this equation, you can divide both sides by 5. This will give you the value of \"x\" in terms of the variable \"x\":\n\nx + 2 = 5\n\nx = 5 - 2\n\nx = 3\n\nSo the solution to the equation is x = 3.\n\n3. √x + 2 = x - 1\n\nTo solve this equation, you need to isolate the variable \"x\" on one side of the equation. You can do this by taking the square root of both sides of the equation and solving for \"x\". This gives you:\n\n√x + 2 = x - 1\n\n(x + 2)² = x² - 4x + 4\n\n(x + 2)² = x² - 2x - 2\n\n(x + 2)² = x(x - 2) - 2\n\n(x + 2)² = x² - 2x\n\n(x + 2)² = x² - 2x + 2\n\n(x + 2)² = x² - 2x\n\nx + 2 = x - 1\n\nx = 1\n\nSo the solution to the equation √x + 2 = x - 1 is x = 1.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions."
