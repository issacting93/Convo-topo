      "content": "You're right, my initial calculation was mistaken. Let me rethink this:\n\n* 4 clothes dry in 5 hours. \n* So in 1 hour, 4/5 = 0.8 clothes dry\n* But that drying rate (0.8 clothes/hour) assumes the clothes were put out gradually over the 5 hours. \n* If all 20 clothes were put out at once, the drying rate would be much faster, since more surface area of the clothes is exposed to the air and sun.\n\nSo with 20 clothes put out at once:\n* The drying rate would be significantly faster than 0.8 clothes/hour. Let's estimate it at 4 clothes/hour.\n* At a rate of 4 clothes/hour, 20 clothes will dry in 20/4 = 5 hours\n\nSo if 4 clothes dry in 5 hours when put out gradually, \n20 clothes will dry in about 5 hours when put out all at once.\n\nMy initial calculation was wrong because I assumed a constant drying rate even when more clothes are put out. In reality, the drying rate will increase significantly when more wet surface area is exposed.\n\nSo the correct answer is: About 5 hours.\n\nMy apologies for the mistake. Let me know if my revised explanation makes sense!"
