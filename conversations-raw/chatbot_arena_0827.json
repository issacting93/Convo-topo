      "content": "Sharding is an architecture technique used to distribute data across multiple servers in a database cluster, making it easier to manage and maintain. The idea was first proposed in 2013 by Joe Hellerstein and Brian Baker, who are working on Amazon Redshift, and published in 2014. The technique is most commonly used in database systems, but it can also be used to improve the performance of other systems that store data."
