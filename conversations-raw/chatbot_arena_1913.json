What is worse, if he leaves the wolf and the goat alone together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the hay, the goat will eat the hay. How does he do it?\n\nSolve this riddle by discussing dialog between: 5 y.o., Critic, Solver, Leader, OCD guy, ADHD guy, \"everything is wrong\" guy, \"guy who will solve correctly\"."

He should also make sure to stay with the wolf and goat until they are both safely across. If he does this, everything will be fine."
