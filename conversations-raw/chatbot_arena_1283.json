      "content": "If the sphere is 1 meter away from your eyes, you can see a portion of the sphere that is equivalent to 1/3 of the sphere's surface area. So, if the sphere has a diameter of 20cm, then its surface area is (20^2) cm^2 = 400 cm^2. Therefore, you can see 1/3 of the surface area of the sphere, which is (1/3) x 400 cm^2 = 133 cm^2."

      "content": "The distance between your eyes and the sphere is 1 meter. The sphere has a diameter of 20 cm. So, the area of one half of the sphere's surface that you can see is (1/2) x 20 cm x 20 cm = 40 cm^2. Therefore, you can see only half of the sphere's surface, which is 40 cm^2 / 400 cm^2 = 0.1 or 10% of the surface area of the sphere."
