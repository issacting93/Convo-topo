She breathes out and vapor engulfs her. Wilted roses smiled at her.\nShe sees a boy with a red jacket. He is the enemy, the reason for everything which happened. His country killed many people she knew.\nHe’s just a boy, she thinks. He’s just a civilian.\nYes, she thinks. A civilian from another country. The enemy country.\nHe’s bound to become a murderer when he grows up.\nYou there! she yells. The boy looks at her.\nThey look at each other for a moment.\nYou’ve killed us all, are you satisfied?\nThe boy is confused.\nYou’ve killed us all too, says the boy.\nShe’s at a loss of words, because he’s right.\nBut you don’t matter, she replies.\nThey look for a moment, her anger filled eyes staring in his sad eyes.\nHe runs away into an alley.\nGood, she thinks. I’ll never see him again.\nBut now she feels a slight bit of remorse. I’ll never see him again.\n\""
