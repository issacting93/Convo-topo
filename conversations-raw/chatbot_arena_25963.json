Cumulus clouds - these are the fluffy clouds that look like cotton balls and are usually found at low altitudes.\n2. Cirrus clouds - these are high, wispy clouds that are often found above the clouds you can see.\n3. Stratus clouds - these are low clouds that often cover the entire sky, making it look gray or overcast.\n4. Cumulonimbus clouds - these are tall, dark clouds that are associated with thunderstorms and hurricanes.\n5. Altocumulus clouds - these are medium-height clouds that are often found in the middle of a sunny day.\n6. Altostratus clouds - these are low, gray clouds that often cover the sky during the day, but clear up at night.\n7. Nimbostratus clouds - these are dark, thick clouds that often bring rain or snow.\n8. Stratocumulus clouds - these are the smallest type of cloud, found at low altitudes and often associated with fog."
