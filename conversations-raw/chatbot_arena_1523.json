      "content": "This is a linear equation in x. One way to solve it is by substitution, where you solve for one variable in terms of the other. \n\nLet y = x^2 - 8x + 12. Then, we can solve for x in terms of y:\n\nx = y^2 - 8y + 12\n\nSubstituting this expression for x into the equation:\n\ny^2 - 8y + 12 = 0\n\nWe get:\n\ny^2 - 8y + 9 = 0\n\nNext, we can simplify the left side by factoring out a common factor:\n\n(y - 3)(y - 5) = 0\n\nTherefore, y = 3 or y = 5, and we can solve for x in terms of these values:\n\nx = y^2 - 8y + 12 = 3^2 - 8(3) + 12 = 5^2 - 8(5) + 12 = 25 - 32 + 12 = -7\n\nx = -7\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 are x = -7 and x = 3."
