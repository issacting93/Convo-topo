This can be done by simply adding the two numbers together, which gives us \"four.\"\n\nNext, we need to find the value of 2 * 2. This can be done by multiplying the two numbers together, which gives us \"4.\"\n\nSo, the final result would be 2 + 2 * 2 = 2 + 4 = 6. This means that 2 + 2 * 2 equals \"six.\""
