      "content": "Yes, it makes sense to say that an object is too small to fit in a box. This phrase is used to describe a situation where an object is unable to fit into a space or container because it is too small for that space or container. For example, if a toy car is too small to fit into a toy box, it means that the toy car is unable to fit into the toy box because it is too small for the toy box."
