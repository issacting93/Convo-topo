      "content": "Freshwater modelling is a process of simulating the flow and behavior of freshwater resources. It is used to understand how water moves through a system, predict its impacts on the environment, and identify strategies to better manage water resources. Freshwater modelling can help inform policy, engineering, and management decisions, such as identifying areas prone to flooding and drought, assessing the effects of climate change on water availability, and evaluating the efficiency of water conservation and reuse strategies."
