I can still sense things with my eyes closed, right? Like my own body, the air around me, maybe even some sounds or smells? So maybe what I see with my eyes closed is more about my internal state, my thoughts and feelings and all that stuff? That's kind of cool actually, I never really thought about it that way before."
