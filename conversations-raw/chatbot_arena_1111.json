      "content": "Fermat's factorization method relies on the fact that if two large prime numbers are close together, then their product will also be close to a prime number. If an attacker can find two large prime numbers that are close to each other, then they can factorize the product of those two numbers to obtain the prime factors of the product.\nThe problem with this approach is that the closer the two prime numbers are, the harder it is to factorize the product. In order for this method to be effective, the two prime numbers must be close together, but not so close that they start to become vulnerable to other attacks.\nIn practice, the security of Fermat's algorithm is limited by the difficulty of finding two large prime numbers that are close together. While the exact distance between prime numbers is not known, it is known that the distance is very small compared to the size of the numbers themselves. As a result, the security of Fermat's algorithm is not significantly affected by the distance between the prime numbers."
