It is understood that the person is not capable or competent to do the task.\n\n\"He\" is a possessive pronoun, which is used to indicate that the subject of the sentence is the person being referred to.\n\nIn the first sentence, \"he\" is used as a subject, which is grammatically correct. In the second sentence, \"nobody\" is used as a direct object, which is not grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be: \"He did the work without anybody to help him.\""
