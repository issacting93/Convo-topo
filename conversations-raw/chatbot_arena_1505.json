      "content": "Gold nanostructures, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), are small particles with sizes typically ranging from 2 to 100 nm. They are made of gold atoms or ions arranged in a small, regular, and repeating pattern. The size and shape of these particles can be controlled during their synthesis. AuNPs have unique optical, electrical, magnetic, and catalytic properties that make them attractive for various applications, such as in biomedical imaging, drug delivery, and sensing."

      "content": "The structure of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is influenced by their size, shape, and the method of synthesis. The most common AuNP structures include:\n1. Spherical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs): These are the smallest and most common. They have a diameter of less than 100 nm and are typically spherical in shape.\n2. Cylindrical gold nanoparticles (AuNPs): These are elongated, with a diameter larger than their length. They are usually less than 100 nm in length.\n3. Rod-like gold nanoparticles (AuNPs): These are long and have a length that is at least twice their height. They have a diameter of less than 10 nm.\n4. Rod-shaped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs): These are cylindrical in shape and have a height that is at least twice their width. They can be several micrometers in length.\n5. Irregular and faceted gold nanoparticles: These are irregular shaped particles with a non-spherical shape. They can have many different shapes and sizes, depending on the synthesis method."
