The correct calculation is actually 2 + 2 \\* 2 = 4\"\n\n\"But wait, what do you mean 2 + 2 \\* 2 = 4? I thought it was 4!\"\n\n\"Yes, you are correct. I apologize for the confusion. 2 + 2 \\* 2 = 4\"\n\nAnd that's it! I hope that helps to clarify the calculation for you. Remember to always double-check your calculations before sharing them with others to avoid confusion."
