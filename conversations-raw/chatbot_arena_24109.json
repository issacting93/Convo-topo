It must contain a subject and a predicate, and it must end with a period, question mark, or exclamation point. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, a sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It can be a dependent clause, an independent clause without a subject, or an independent clause without a predicate. Sentence fragments are not considered to be sentences, so they do not need to end with punctuation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some sentences are punctuated with an ellipsis (three periods) to indicate that something has been omitted. For example, \"I went to the store, I bought some milk, and I came home.\" could be punctuated as \"I went to the store, I bought some milk, and I came home ...\". This would indicate that there is more information that has been left out of the sentence.\r\n\r\nFinally, some sentences are punctuated with a dash (two hyphens) to indicate a break in thought or to set off a phrase. For example, \"I went to the store--I needed some milk.\" could be punctuated as \"I went to the store--I needed some milk.\" This would indicate that there is a pause in the speaker's thought or that the phrase \"I needed some milk\" is being set off from the rest of the sentence."
