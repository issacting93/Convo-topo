Is it an acronym for a particular product? The name of a company? A software standard or protocol?\n\nSome possibilities could be:\n\n- A product name like \"Software MAX\" or \"System MAX\"\n\n- An acronym like \"Software Management, Analytics and eXchange\"\n\n- A protocol name like \"Secure MAX\" \n\n- A company name like \"SMAX Technologies\"\n\nBut without more details from you, I cannot say definitively what \"SMAX\" refers to. Can you provide any additional context or details?"

This is Micro Focus' software-defined automation and analytics platform for managing, monitoring and optimizing enterprise IT infrastructure and applications. \n\nSome of the capabilities of SMAX may include:\n\n• Discovery and visibility into servers, virtual machines, containers and cloud environments.\n\n• Automation of provisioning, configuration, patching and compliance management of IT infrastructure.\n\n• Predictive analytics and optimization recommendations based on machine learning.\n\n• Cost management and optimization to reduce infrastructure spend. \n\n• Open integration capabilities with third-party tools and public cloud platforms.\n\nHowever, without seeing this product directly, I cannot confirm these details with certainty. Does this help summarize what \"SMAX\" refers to, or would you like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary?"
