Place the chunks in a pot with a small amount of water and cook until the apples are tender. Mash the apples with a spoon or potato masher, then add a tablespoon of lemon juice to prevent browning. Finally, sweeten the sauce to your taste, and serve."

It’s a dark coming-of-age tale about four teenage girls who discover witchcraft, and features powerful performances from its young cast. It was ahead of its time in exploring themes of female empowerment, teen angst, and witchcraft, and its gothic visuals give it an enduringly unique aesthetic."
