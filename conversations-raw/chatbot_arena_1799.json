He was a member of the Committee of Public Safety and was responsible for the Reign of Terror, a period of violence during which many people were executed for being perceived as threats to the Revolution. Robespierre was eventually arrested and executed himself in 1794."

Marat was a strong advocate for the rights of the lower classes and supported the use of violence to achieve political goals. He was assassinated in his bathtub by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer, in 1793."
