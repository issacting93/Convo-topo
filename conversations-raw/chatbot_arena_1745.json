Be attentive to their emotional and physical needs, and try to fulfill them as much as possible. Surprise them with small gestures of affection, such as leaving a love note or preparing their favorite meal. Remember that pleasing your partner is not about doing everything they want, but about finding a balance that makes both of you happy and fulfilled."

Define the data structure: Define the data structure that will hold all the information in the encyclopedia. You can use a map data type to store the key-value pairs of the entries.\n\n2. Create a function to add entries: Create a function that will allow users to add new entries to the encyclopedia. This function should prompt the user to enter the title of the entry and its content. The function should then add the entry to the map data structure.\n\n3. Create a function to search entries: Create a function that allows users to search for entries in the encyclopedia. This function should prompt the user to enter a search term and then search through the entries for any that match the term. The function should then display the matching entries.\n\n4. Create a function to display all entries: Create a function that displays all the entries in the encyclopedia. This function should iterate through the map data structure and display the title and content of each entry.\n\n5. Create a main function: Create a main function that will initialize the map data structure and call the other functions as needed. This function should present a menu of options to the user (such as add a new entry, search for an entry, or display all entries) and then call the appropriate function based on the user's choice.\n\nHere is some sample code to give you a general idea:\n\n```\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// define the data structure\nvar encyclopedia = make(map[string]string)\n\n// function to add entries\nfunc addEntry() {\n    var title, content string\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter title: \")\n    fmt.Scanln(&title)\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter content: \")\n    fmt.Scanln(&content)\n    encyclopedia[title] = content\n}\n\n// function to search entries\nfunc searchEntry() {\n    var search string\n    fmt.Print(\"Enter search term: \")\n    fmt.Scanln(&search)\n    for title, content := range encyclopedia {\n        if contains(content, search) {\n            fmt.Println(title, \": \", content)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// function to display all entries\nfunc displayEntries() {\n    for title, content := range encyclopedia {\n        fmt.Println(title, \": \", content)\n    }\n}\n\n// main function\nfunc main() {\n    for {\n        fmt.Println(\"Encyclopedia Options:\")\n        fmt.Println(\"1. Add a new entry\")\n        fmt.Println(\"2. Search for an entry\")\n        fmt.Println(\"3. Display all entries\")\n        fmt.Println(\"4. Exit\")\n        var choice int\n        fmt.Scanln(&choice)\n        switch choice {\n        case 1:\n            addEntry()\n        case 2:\n            searchEntry()\n        case 3:\n            displayEntries()\n        case 4:\n            return\n        default:\n            fmt.Println(\"Invalid choice\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// helper function to check if a string contains a substring\nfunc contains(s, substr string) bool {\n    return len(s) >= len(substr) && s[:len(substr)] == substr\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just a sample code and you may need to modify it to suit your specific requirements."
