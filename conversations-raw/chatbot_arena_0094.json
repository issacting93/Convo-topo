Instead of the fellowship, there would have been a group of adventurers battling the forces of evil and corruption. The creatures and races of Middle Earth would have been much more alien and nightmarish, and the themes of despair and hopelessness would have been more prominent. The ultimate fate of the characters would have been much more uncertain, and the ending would have been much more bittersweet."

These gods would have served as powerful forces of chaos and destruction, lurking in the shadows and conspiring against the fellowship."

      "content": "Varda, the Queen of the Stars, can be seen as a Lovecraftian Outer God. In the mythology, she is described as an immense and ancient being who exists in a realm beyond the stars. She is also said to have a powerful, mysterious, and potentially malevolent influence on the events of the world. This fits in with the theme of Lovecraft’s work, in which powerful and malevolent Outer Gods exist in a realm beyond our own, seeking to disrupt and destroy our reality."
