It is used to determine the structure of compounds, study how molecules interact, and identify different types of molecules in a sample. It works by using a magnetic field to cause the nucleus of certain atoms to align and then exciting them with a radio frequency pulse. Once the nucleus is excited, it will release a signal that can be detected and used to gain information about the molecules in the sample."
