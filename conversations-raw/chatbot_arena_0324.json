Building and maintaining strong friendships can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be just as fulfilling as a hobby you enjoy.\n\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and happiness. Make sure to do things that make you feel good, whether that means taking time for yourself, engaging in creative activities, or simply relaxing and unwinding. Taking care of your physical health and well-being is also important for overall happiness and well-being."

I have a well paying job that i enjoy a lot - i expanded my social circle by a lot and i am very happy - to the degree that i feel bad complaining in the sense of \"First world problems\". Especially since i know that it basically is my own fault because i am not putting in any effort to date"

      "content": "It's understandable to feel frustrated when you compare yourself to others and feel like you're not living up to your full potential. It can be easy to feel as though you're not putting in the effort when it comes to building and maintaining social connections, which can make it feel like you're missing out on the things that other people have.\n\nIt's important to remember that having a fulfilling life doesn't necessarily come from finding the perfect person or putting in the effort to date. It can also be helpful to focus on self-care and happiness as a way to maintain your own well-being and not let external pressures or expectations affect your happiness."
