Elisabetta Versace and\nher colleagues used an image of three black dots\narranged in the shape of eyes and a nose or mouth\nto test whether this trait also occurs in Testudo\ntortoises, which live alone and do not engage in\nparental care. They found that tortoise hatchlings\nshowed a significant preference for the image,\nsuggesting that ______\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?\nA) face-like stimuli are likely perceived as harmless\nby newborns of social species that practice\nparental care but as threatening by newborns of\nsolitary species without parental care.\nB) researchers should not assume that an innate\nattraction to face-like stimuli is necessarily an\nadaptation related to social interaction or\nparental care.\nC) researchers can assume that the attraction to\nface-like stimuli that is seen in social species that\npractice parental care is learned rather than\ninnate.\nD) newly hatched Testudo tortoises show a stronger\npreference for face-like stimuli than adult\nTestudo tortoises do"
