It then generates a set of random points within the specified range, evaluates the function at each point, and returns the average of those values as an approximate value of the integral.\nThe example function used in this script is `example_func`, which takes in a single argument `x` and returns the exponential of -x**2. In the main `monte_carlo_integration` function, we call `example_func` with 10000 trials and print the result."

It then uses the finite difference formula to approximate the gradient of the function at the starting point and returns that value.\nThe example function used in this script is `example_func`, which takes in a single argument `x` and returns x^2. In the main `finite_difference` function, we call `example_func` with a step size of 0.1 and print the result, which should be the approximate value of the gradient from x=0 to x=1."
