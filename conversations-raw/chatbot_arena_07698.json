I'm looking for activities using regular gym equipment, jumping rope, and gymnastic rings which will be both aerobic and anaerobic exercise. I can probably get 15-20 minutes a day of exercise during weekdays and 1 hour during weekends. Help me plan a 1 month ramping up plan and a regular plan after that achieving the 75min high intensity weekly goal, assume the week starts on sunday"
