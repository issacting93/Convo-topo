For some people, embracing nihilism can be beneficial because it can help them to make decisions based on their own values and not be influenced by external expectations or pressures. It can also help them to face life's difficulties with a more positive and realistic attitude, knowing that their struggles ultimately mean nothing in the grand scheme of things."
