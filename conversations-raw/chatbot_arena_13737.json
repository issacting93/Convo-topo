If the weapons are being built to protect people or to prevent further harm, then it may not be unethical. However, if the weapons are being built with the intent of causing harm or for offensive purposes, then it may be unethical. It is important to consider the potential consequences of one's work before engaging in it."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "It is not feasible for us to stop using weapons for deterrence because many societies face the danger of aggression and violence, and weapons are necessary to protect citizens from harm in the short term. Furthermore, alternative methods of resolution that do not rely on weapons often take time to develop and implement, and in the meantime, weapons are necessary for protection."
