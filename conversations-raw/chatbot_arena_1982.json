      "content": "Sure, I can do that. Here is a solution in the style of a Veritasium video:\n\nWe start with the equation $2 + 2 * 2$. We can then multiply the 2s together, giving us $2 + 4$. Finally, we add 2 to 4, giving us the answer $6$.\n\nBut what if we did things a little differently? What if we multiplied the 2s first, giving us $4 + 2$? Then we could add 2 to that, giving us $6$ again.\n\nOr what if we did things even differently? What if we added the 2s first, giving us $4 + 4$? Then we could divide that by 2, giving us $6$ again.\n\nSo, which is it? Is the answer 6 or 4? The answer is that it depends on how you interpret the question. If you interpret the question as asking for the answer to the equation $2 + 2 * 2$, then the answer is 6. However, if you interpret the question as asking for the answer to the equation $2(2 + 2)$, then the answer is 4.\n\nThis is an example of how ambiguity can lead to different answers in mathematics. It is important to be clear about what you mean when you ask a question, or else you may not get the answer you are expecting."
