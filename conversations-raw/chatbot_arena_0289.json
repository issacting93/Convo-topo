      "content": "Sure! Here is a step-by-step explanation of how to find the derivative of cos(2x):\n\n1. Start by writing the function as a sum of two terms: cos(2x) = 1/2 (1 + cos(2x)).\n2. Next, use the chain rule to find the derivative of the first term (1/2):\n\n(d/dx) (1/2) = (1/2) \\* (1/2) = 1/4\n\n1. Now, use the chain rule again to find the derivative of the second term (cos(2x)):\n\n(d/dx) (cos(2x)) = -sin(2x) (d/dx) (cos(2x)) = -sin(2x) \\* (-2cos(2x)) = 2sin(2x)\n\n1. Finally, combine the two results to find the derivative of cos(2x):\n\n(d/dx) cos(2x) = (1/4) - (2sin(2x)) = 1/4 - 2sin(2x)\n\n1. And that's it! The derivative of cos(2x) is -sin(2x)."
