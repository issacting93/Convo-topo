Buses run regularly to destinations throughout Iran, including Tehran, Damavand, and Mashhad. The terminal is well-organized and staffed with information kiosks, ticket offices, and car rentals. If you plan to travel by bus, it's a good idea to buy tickets in advance, as schedules can be subject to change."
