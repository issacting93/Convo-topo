For example, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8, 5 + 8 = 13, and so on. \nTherefore, to find the next number in the sequence, we simply add the last two numbers, which are 13 + 21 = 34. However, since we know that each number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers, we can also express the next number in the sequence as 21 - 13 + 13, which simplifies to 21. \nIn summary, the next number in the sequence is 21 because it is the sum of the previous two numbers, which are 13 and 21."
