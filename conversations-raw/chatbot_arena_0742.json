      "content": "Poems often have a regular rhythm (meter) and rhyme scheme, with lines of the same length (lines of the same number of syllables) and sometimes a set number of beats per line. A poem can be in the form of a narrative, but it may also take other forms, such as an autobiography, a dramatic monologue, or a lyric. It can be written in the form of a song, or it can be spoken."

      "content": "A poem is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, ones the prose forms usually convey. Poems frequently use forms and conventions to suggest alternative interpretations of words or concepts, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses."
