      "content": "Nano x imaging has two main product listings: cameras and lenses. Their cameras, which can record video in HD, are generally good, but their lenses, which start at $399, are generally bad. This is because the Nano x imaging cameras are too large and their lenses are too small. As a result, their lenses are difficult to focus and are not sharp. In addition, because of their large size, their cameras are also prone to rolling shutter issues in which the video is out of sync because of inconsistencies in when the camera is capturing the image. Finally, their website is difficult to use and does not provide a strong value proposition for why a customer would buy their products over other similar products. Overall, I think Nano x imaging has a good product listing for their cameras, but their lenses are too expensive and poor in quality."
