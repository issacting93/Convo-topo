If the plane was registered under the flag of France, the survivors of the crash would likely be buried in France. If the plane was registered under the flag of Germany, the survivors of the crash would likely be buried in Germany.\n\nIt's important to note that the nationality of the plane's crew, passengers, and any survivors following a crash on the border between France and Germany would also play a role in determining which country would be responsible for the burial of the survivors.\n\nAdditionally, in the event of a crash on the border between France and Germany, the relevant authorities from both countries would likely work together to determine the proper disposition of the survivors and any remains."
