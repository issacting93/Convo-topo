Here's an example code for a simple logistic regression model in Python using the scikit-learn library:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\n# Load the dataset\n# (assuming the dataset is in a CSV file with two columns: X and Y)\nX = np.array([[0, 0], [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]])\ny = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0]])\n\n# Create and fit the model\nmodel = LogisticRegression()\nmodel.fit(X, y)\n\n# Predict new data\ny_pred = model.predict([[4, 4]])\nprint(y_pred)\n\n# Display the performance metrics\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", model.score(X, y))\nprint(\"Area under the ROC curve:\", model.roc_auc_score(X, y))\n```\nIn this example, the `scikit-learn` library is used to import the necessary functions for the logistic regression model. The `LogisticRegression` class is used to create the model, which is then fit to the training data (X and y).\n\nThe `predict` method is used to predict the outcome of a new input (in this case, [4, 4]). The `score` and `roc_auc_score` methods are used to display the performance metrics for the model.\n\nPlease note that this is just a basic example, and there are many other options and configurations that can be used with the `LogisticRegression` model."
