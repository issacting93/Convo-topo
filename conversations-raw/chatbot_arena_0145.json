      "content": "A \"major general\" is a military officer who leads a large, professional army.  In the United States and during the early years of the 20th century, a Major General was the highest-ranked officer in the U.S. Army and held the rank of Lieutenant General.  Later in the 20th century, the term \"Major General\" was replaced by \"General\" and the rank of General was removed.  Modern Major Generals are still the highest-ranked officers in the U.S. military, but they are not considered the highest-ranking officers in any other country's military."
