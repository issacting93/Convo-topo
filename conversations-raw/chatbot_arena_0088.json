In the song, Smino compares himself to a panda, using the metaphor to describe his laid-back and relaxed personality. The line about riding a bicycle is a playful reference to the panda's black and white coloring, while the line about sipping tea is a nod to the animal's reputation for being a gentle and serene creature. Overall, this line is a fun and whimsical moment in the song, showcasing Smino's unique and creative approach to rap."
