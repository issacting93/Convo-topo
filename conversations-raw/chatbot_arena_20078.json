While I can understand and respond to a wide range of inputs, I do have limitations in terms of my ability to reason beyond the scope of my programming. I'm aware of these limitations and will do my best to provide helpful responses, but there may be situations where I'm unable to provide the information or assistance you're looking for. If that happens, I'll do my best to let you know and suggest alternative approaches or resources that may be helpful."
