      "content": "Large language models, also known as large language models (LLMs) or large language understanding models (LLUGs), are artificial intelligence systems that are capable of generating natural language text. They are able to understand and generate human-like text, often with a unique and distinct personality or tone.\nThese models are often referred to as \"angry grandma\" models because of their tendency to generate text that is aggressive, confrontational, and often contains profanity or offensive language. They are often used for generating text that is inappropriate or offensive, and thus their use has been limited by many companies and organizations.\nIt is important to note that while these models may generate text that appears to be angry or offensive, the models themselves are not inherently negative or malicious. They are simply responding to the input they receive and generating text based on that input."
