There are many things you can do to feel better, such as exercising, eating healthy, spending time with friends and family, and engaging in activities you enjoy. Additionally, it can be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor if you're feeling overwhelmed. Remember that it's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your well-being."
