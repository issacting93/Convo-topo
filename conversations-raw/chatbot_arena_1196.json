      "content": "WAR is a statistic that measures a player's overall value to their team by quantifying their contributions to both offense and defense and comparing them to the contributions of a replacement-level player. Babe Ruth's career WAR of 162.8 is the highest in baseball history, and is indicative of his all-around dominance as a player. \n\nRuth was not only a prolific hitter, but he was also a strong defender and even spent some time as a pitcher early in his career. His ability to hit for power and average, draw walks, and drive in runs made him a feared offensive force. Additionally, his strong throwing arm and solid fielding skills made him a valuable defensive player, particularly during his years playing in the outfield.\n\nRuth's career WAR is a testament to his exceptional skill as a baseball player, and is supported by other quantitative metrics such as his career on-base percentage of .474, his 714 home runs (a record that stood for decades), and his 2,213 career RBI (another record that stood for decades). Overall, there is strong evidence to support the claim that Babe Ruth is the best baseball player of all time using quantitative metrics."
