      "content": "\"Here be dragons\" is a phrase that has been used for centuries to indicate the presence of dangerous or uncharted territories on maps. The phrase originated in the Middle Ages, when cartographers added it to maps to indicate the limits of their knowledge and the areas that were too dangerous or unknown to navigate.\n\nIn modern times, the phrase \"here be dragons\" is often used figuratively to refer to uncharted or uncertain territory, or to represent a situation that is unknown or difficult to handle. It can also be used as a warning, to caution others that there are dangers or challenges ahead."
