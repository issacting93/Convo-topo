      "content": "To solve for x in the equation 2x + 4 = 8, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. One way to do this is by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n2x + 4 = 8\n\n2x = 8 - 4\n\n2x = 4\n\nTo find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 again:\n\nx = 4 / 2\n\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, the value of x is 2."
