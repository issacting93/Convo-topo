      "content": "It is difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms without a medical examination, but you may be experiencing gastritis, which is a type of stomach inflammation or infection. Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by a number of different things, such as a viral or bacterial infection, or even by anxiety or stress. It is possible that you have a viral infection of the stomach, such as the common cold or flu, but it is also possible that you have a more serious stomach problem that requires medical attention. I would recommend seeing a doctor if you are experiencing any of these symptoms, as they can help determine the cause and appropriate treatment."
