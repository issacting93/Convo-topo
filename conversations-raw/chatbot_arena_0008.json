My first thought would be to protect myself and my loved ones, so I would try to gather them together and flee the village as quickly as possible. I would likely be thinking about where we can go to safety and how we can get there.\n\nMy plans would likely involve trying to reach the nearest town or city, where we might be able to find shelter and safety. I would try to avoid any areas where the orcs might be, and would likely take a route that I know well so that we can move quickly and avoid getting lost.\n\nIn the short term, my main goal would be to get as far away from the orcs as possible and to find a place where we can be safe. In the longer term, I would hope to find a way to defeat the orcs and drive them away, so that we can return to our village and our normal lives."

I would try to move as quickly as possible, while also being cautious and staying alert for any signs of danger.\n\nAlong the way, I would be thinking about what we might need to bring with us, such as food, water, and other supplies. I would also be trying to remember any information that might be useful, such as the location of any other safe places that we could go if we needed to.\n\nWhen we reached the castle, my hope would be that it would be a strong and secure place where we could find refuge and safety. I would likely be looking for the nearest entrance and trying to find a way inside, while also being aware of any potential dangers that might be waiting for us.\n\nOnce we were inside the castle, my plans would be to try to find a place where we could hide and rest for a while. I would be looking for a room or area that was secure and where we could be safe from any further danger. I would also be thinking about what we might need to do to stay alive and survive, such as finding food and water and staying warm."
