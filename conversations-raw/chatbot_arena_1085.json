      "content": "Perplexity is a measure for the quality of the test set for a given model. The model is given a set of inputs and outputs and the goal is to make the model predict the correct output. If the model is perfect, it should be able to predict all outputs correctly. However, in this case, the model would be able to predict all outputs with 100% certainty. When the model is able to correctly predict all outputs with 100% certainty, the model is said to have reached 'perplexity 1'. The lower the perplexity for a model, the better the model is at predicting outputs."
