You should keep your cards in your hand a secret unless a card effect requires you to reveal them. Let's assume that our decks have been shuffled. To start, we each need to draw 5 cards from our decks.\n\nCan you simulate drawing five random cards from my Starter Deck Kaiba for me? You should also draw five cards from Starter Deck Yugi for yourself but should not reveal their names to me."
