      "content": "You can start a process once another one has finished by using the `os.wait()` function in Python. This function waits for a specific process to complete and then returns the exit status of the process. You can then use the exit status to determine whether the other process has finished or not.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `os.wait()` to start a process once another one has finished:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport os\n\n# Start the first process\nprocess1 = subprocess.Popen(['python', 'example.py'])\n\n# Wait for the first process to finish\ntime.sleep(1)\n\n# Check if the first process has finished\nif process1.poll() is not None:\n    print('First process has finished')\nelse:\n    print('First process did not finish')\n\n# Start the second process\nprocess2 = subprocess.Popen(['sleep', '5'])\n\n# Wait for the second process to finish\nwhile process2.poll() is None:\n    time.sleep(1)\n\n# Check if the second process has finished\nif process2.poll() is not None:\n    print('Second process has finished')\nelse:\n    print('Second process did not finish')\n```\n\nIn this example, `process1` starts a Python script called `example.py` that prints a message. The `os.wait()` function is then used to wait for `process1` to finish. Once `process1` has finished, the `poll()` method of the process object is used to check whether the process has finished or not.\n\nSimilarly, `process2` starts a sleep process and is waited for until it has finished. The `poll()` method is again used to check whether the process has finished or not.\n\nNote that the `poll()` method of the process object may not be accurate if the process has been terminated by a signal or other means. In this case, you may need to use other methods to check whether the process has finished or not, such as using the `wait()` method with a timeout or checking the exit status of the process."
