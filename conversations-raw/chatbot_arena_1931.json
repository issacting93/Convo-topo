      "content": "The logistic map is a model for population growth proposed by the Belgian mathematician and physicist Pierre-Louis Verhulst in 1838. It depicts the change in the probability that a population will survive from one generation to the next based on the size of the current population. The logistic map is also known as the Verhulst equation because Verhulst was the first to propose it. It is given by the equation:"
