I've been in a few different Muslim countries and during their holy month on Ramadan where they fast every day and eat at night (usually fast all day until around 7:30pm).  I've been invited out to eat with new muslim friend here and there when they break fast.  It's really a sobering experience.  One guy shared with me his dinner that he brought that his mom cooked.  Another one was poor and still insisted on paying for our dinner. We'd never hear of such kindness and generosity from the fake news media about that.  It's really a humbling experience. "

During Ramadan, when Muslims fast all day and eat after sunset, I've been invited to break fast with new Muslim friends.  They share their meals and insist on paying, despite being poor.  Such kindness and generosity contrast with negative media portrayals. It's a humbling experience."

I suggested that they take some supplements (that I researched) and they did but they only had like 2-3 days worth.  It turns out their recovery was much faster than their family members even though they had only a short amount."

Joe is lucky and blessed to have at least one of his grandparents alive. God knows that I had none.  I told her mother that she can stay as long as she wants and that she's always welcome here. Maybe the mother-in-law relationship might be different if you married a man? In asian cultures the new wife must obey her mother-in-law.  However, in a traditional patriarchy, the mother-in-law treats the son-in-law with respect and approval."
