      "content": "Yes, I can certainly help with that! In general, a meteor is a small rock or piece of debris that is orbiting the Sun, while an asteroid is a larger, rocky object that is also orbiting the Sun. Meteoroids are the smallest, typically microscopic, particles of debris in space. When a meteoroid enters Earth's atmosphere, it is called a meteor, and it can be visible to the naked eye as it burns up due to friction with the air. If a meteoroid is large enough, it can survive the trip through the atmosphere and land on the ground, which is known as a meteorite. Asteroids are typically much larger than meteorites, and they can be found orbiting in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter."
