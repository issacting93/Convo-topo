      "content": "The derivative of a function can be found by taking the slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph. It is represented by a derivative function and is defined as the rate of change of the function at that point. To calculate the derivative of a function, you must first find the slope of the tangent line at a point on the graph. The derivative can then be determined by differentiating the function at that point."
