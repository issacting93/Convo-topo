There's nothing wrong with this sentence.\n2. \"you can help me by correcting every mistake I had made\" - The sentence is grammatically correct, but you might want to say \"you can help me by correcting every mistake I make\" to make it more clear. This is because the word \"had\" implies that the mistakes happened in the past, while \"make\" implies that the mistakes will happen in the future."
