      "content": "On a standard 88-key piano, the keys are organized in a piano keyboard layout that follows a standard arrangement of white and black keys. The white keys are labeled with Roman numerals from I to XII, and the black keys are labeled with Arabic numerals from 1 to 88. The space between the white and black keys is divided into eight octaves, with each octave containing eight keys.\n\nThe arrangement of the keys on a piano keyboard can vary depending on the type of piano and the musician's preferences. However, the standard 88-key piano layout is a widely used and familiar arrangement that is used in many different music genres."

      "content": "An octave is the interval between two notes with the same letter name (e.g. Do-Re-Mi), but with one note having a higher pitch and the other having a lower pitch. A piano has eight octaves, with each octave containing eight keys.\n\nEach octave in a piano consists of two half-octaves, with the higher pitch note in the upper half-octave and the lower pitch note in the lower half-octave. In an octave on a piano, the black keys are always located one half-step below the white keys. For example, if the white key at the top of an octave is labeled \"C,\" the black key directly below it will be labeled \"C#.\"\n\nThere are a total of 88 white keys on a standard piano, and each white key is divided into two half-keys (C-C# and C-D). In addition, there are also a total of 88 black keys on a standard piano, and each black key is divided into two half-keys (C-C# and D-D).\n\nTherefore, in an octave on a piano, there are a total of 16 white keys and 16 black keys, for a total of 32 keys in an octave."
