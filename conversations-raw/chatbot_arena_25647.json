      "content": "The difference between decoders and decoders-encoders in the context of AI models is that decoders are used to take an encoded output and generate a prediction, while decoders-encoders are used to take an encoded output and generate a new encoded output. Decoders-encoders are typically used when the output of the model needs to be further processed, such as when generating a sequence of tokens from a text input."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "BERT models are special because they are transformer-based language models that use a combination of deep learning and natural language processing to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, such as text classification, text generation, and question answering. They are also efficient and easy to use, making them a popular choice for many AI applications."
