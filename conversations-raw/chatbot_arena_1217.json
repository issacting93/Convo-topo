      "content": "Arm Assembly Language (AAL) is a low-level programming language that is used to program microprocessors and other devices that are based on the Arm architecture. It is a symbolic assembly language, which means that it is made up of mnemonics and it represents a specific processor instruction in symbolic form. AAL is used to write device drivers, embedded software, and low-level programs for game consoles, operating systems, and other applications."

The instruction STR stores data from the register R3 to memory location R2. The instruction MOV moves the contents of the register R3 to the register R4, and the BNE instruction is used to perform a branch if the value of R3 is not equal to R4."

It contains the flags that indicate the result of the last instruction and the status of the processor. The CPSR is used to control the operation of the processor, including branching and interrupts."
