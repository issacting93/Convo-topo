      "content": "Social epistemology is a branch of philosophy that studies the ways in which knowledge is created, shared, and justified within social contexts. It examines the social and cultural factors that influence the acquisition, evaluation, and dissemination of knowledge, and how these factors affect the reliability and validity of knowledge claims. Social epistemology considers questions such as: How do we know what we know? How do we decide what counts as knowledge? What role do social and cultural factors play in shaping our understanding of the world?"
