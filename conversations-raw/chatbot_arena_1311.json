      "content": "In the three pines mysteries by Daniel Stashower, three pines is the code name for a top-secret government project to create a synthetic human being. The three pines were founded by Katharine Branson, a black- ops specialist who had worked for the CIA, and her husband, Richard, a Nobel Prize– winning geneticist. The project was funded by a secret advanced research fund, and its purpose was to create a perfect human replica, with the DNA extracted from the blood of Richard's sister, Judy, a scientific genius who had died in a car accident.\n\nThe project was plagued by problems from the start. The first human subject, Benjamin Goodley, committed suicide after weeks of distress. His DNA sequence was lost, and the synthetic brain that was developed from it was not sophisticated enough to analyze Goodley's state of mind. Judy's DNA, on the other hand, provided the crucial ingredient to create a synthetic human being with a conscious mind. The three pines was renamed in Judy's honor, and Benjamin Goodley became the first synthetic human, or Syngman Rhee."
