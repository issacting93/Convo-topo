      "content": "\"Metamorphosis\" is a novella by Franz Kafka, first published in 1915. It tells the story of Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman who wakes up one day to find himself transformed into a giant insect-like creature. The narrative explores themes of alienation, family dynamics, and the human condition as Gregor struggles to adapt to his new form and his family grapples with the consequences of his transformation. Amidst societal expectations and personal challenges, the story ultimately examines the shifting relationships and emotional turmoil experienced by Gregor and his family in the face of an inexplicable metamorphosis."
