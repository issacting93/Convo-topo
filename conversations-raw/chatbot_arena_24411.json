      "content": "To find out how long it will take to dry 30 t-shirts, we can use the following formula:\n\nTime = (Number of items) x (Time per item)\n\nSince it takes 3 hours to dry 6 t-shirts, we can divide 30 t-shirts by 6 t-shirts to get the number of hours it will take to dry 30 t-shirts:\n\nTime = (30) x (3)\n\nTime = 90 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 90 hours to dry 30 t-shirts in the sun."

      "content": "You are correct, my previous response assumed that the drying process was sequential, which is not the case when drying multiple items in parallel. To account for the parallel process, we can use the following formula:\n\nEstimated Time = (Number of items) x (Time per item) / (Number of drying processes)\n\nSince we are drying 30 t-shirts in parallel, we can divide 30 by 6 to get the number of drying processes:\n\nNumber of drying processes = 30 / 6 = 5\n\nTime = (30) x (3) / (5) = 9 hours\n\nSo, it will take approximately 9 hours to dry 30 t-shirts in the sun when drying them in parallel."
