The report follows a three-step process: (1) A survey of employees to measure engagement and determine the most important prompts for automation; (2) An AI-driven prompt engine to generate prompts based on the survey responses; and (3) An evaluation of the effectiveness of the prompts in increasing engagement and productivity. The results show that the AI-driven prompt engine increased engagement and productivity in the short term, and the integration of prompts to ensure inclusivity in the long term is feasible. The report concludes that the use of AI technology in prompt engineering to increase engagement in corporate culture has the potential to increase productivity and integrate a more inclusive workplace in the long term."
