Additionally, Ge'ez is a language that is primarily written, rather than spoken, so it is possible that this phrase may be used less commonly in everyday conversation.\n\nOverall, the Ge'ez language is a rich and complex language with a long history and a significant cultural heritage. It is an important part of the culture and history of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and it continues to be an important part of the lives of people in these countries today."
