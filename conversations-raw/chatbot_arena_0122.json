I would then gently correct their misinformation by providing accurate information and evidence to support my position. If the person is unwilling to listen or persists in their misinformation, I would try to redirect the conversation to a different topic or explain the importance of accurate information in a broader sense."

If the lies are part of a broader pattern of dishonesty or manipulation, I would try to encourage the other person to be more transparent and honest in the future. If the lies are causing harm or are a significant problem, I would try to work with the other person to find a solution that addresses both the facts and the underlying motivations."
