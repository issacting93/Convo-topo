The button \"Random Color\" is added using the `` onclick `` attribute, and when it is clicked, the function `` randomColor() `` is called. The `` randomColor() `` function first selects 4 random colors from an array of colors (red, green, blue, yellow), and then sets the background color of the element with the ID \"color-text\" to a random color. The second `` randomColor() `` function also selects 4 random colors, but then sets the text content of the element with the ID \"color-text\" to a random color.\n\nNote that the `` onclick `` attribute is used to call the `` randomColor() `` function when the button is clicked. The `` Math.random() `` function is used to generate a random number, and the `` Math.floor() `` function is used to convert the random number to an integer.
