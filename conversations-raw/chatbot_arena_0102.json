This can happen when the sample is not randomly selected, which can lead to the inclusion of individuals who are different from the population being studied.\n\nOne way to visualize selection bias using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is to consider the following diagram:\n\n\n```lua\n                                                    +\n                                                    |\n                                                    v\n                                                   +-----------------+\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |\n                                                   |           |"
