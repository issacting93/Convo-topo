The idea is to provide a proper farewell for the deceased, but also acknowledge that the body will be returned to the earth and will decay after a few days.\n\n\"Ephemeralization\" is the process of making that final farewell more permanent by encoding the farewell messages from the family and friends of the deceased in a medium that can be preserved for future generations. This might be in the form of a message in a bottle that is thrown into the sea, or a coffin that is sealed with a time capsule.\n\nThis concept is not unique to Funerals, it is quite common to see time capsules at new construction projects and even at some tourist destinations (e.g. under the streets of Venice, Italy)."

      "content": "The CHIP-8 coding scheme was developed in the early 1980s as a simple and compact way of storing structured data, and has become popular again due to the Internet's growing need for compact data storage. The coding scheme uses eight bits to represent each of the 21 ASCII characters plus the space and tab characters. Although the storage efficiency has improved over the years, the coding scheme remains compact for modern data sets, and is still widely used in the data storage community."
