      "content": "There is a lot of debate about pineapple on pizza because it is a controversial topping that people either love or hate. Some people find the combination of savory pizza and sweet pineapple to be delicious, while others find it to be an unusual and unappealing flavor combination. Additionally, some people feel strongly that pineapple does not belong on pizza because it does not fit with traditional pizza toppings or the historical origins of pizza."
