      "content": "Direct indexing uses an offset value stored in a register to directly access an item within an array. Indirect indexing uses an offset value stored in a register to access an array itself. This offset is used to calculate the address of the item within the array which is then retrieved. As an example, in the 6502 architecture, the instruction LDA (‘array’, X) will load the value at the array location specified by the value in the X register. This can be used to either directly or indirectly access a value within an array."
