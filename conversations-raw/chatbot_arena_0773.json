      "content": "Both \"He is too careful to notice it.He is too careful not to notice it.\" are grammatically correct, but the first one is more commonly used. \"He is too careful to notice it\" suggests that he takes great care to notice something, while \"He is too careful not to notice it\" suggests that he is too careful to miss something. The use of \"it\" in the first sentence suggests that there is something specific that he is being careful to notice, while the use of \"it\" in the second sentence suggests that there is something in general that he is being careful not to notice."

This is because you're so careful not to hurt the toy that you sometimes don't see what's wrong. Similarly, when someone is being careful not to notice something, they're not looking closely enough to see what's wrong."
