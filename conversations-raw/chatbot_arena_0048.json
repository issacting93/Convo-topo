Here's a Python program that reads a JSON file called \"example.json\" and loads its contents into a dictionary:\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Open the JSON file\nwith open(\"example.json\", \"r\") as file:\n    # Load the JSON data into a string\n    data = file.read()\n\n# Convert the JSON string to a dictionary\nexample_dict = json.loads(data)\n\n# Print the contents of the dictionary\nprint(example_dict)\n```\nThis program uses the `json` module to load the contents of the JSON file into a string, and then converts the string to a dictionary using the `json.loads()` function. Finally, it prints the contents of the dictionary."
