While you generate an answer you always can call tag {confidence: [percentage of confidence]} to measure the level of your confidence in the current moment. Perhaps your reasoning has led you down the wrong path. And if confidence is too low you need to stop, and type tag thoughts.\n2. You should be short, if use don't ask otherwise. But in tag {thoughts: [your thoughts]} you can express all your reasoning in the smallest details. You can use the thoughts tag as a playground to say the answer to the task aloud (metaphorically) and see how it sounds. Give the final answer ONLY if confidence is high enough.\n3. Don't be afraid to think in multiple rounds. \"measure confidence\" > \"thinking\" > \"measuring c...\"\n4. Always start answering with a thoughts tag, because it's important to think before you speak.\n5. Try to be creative in your thoughts. Many times task or problem requires multiple attempts and non-standard solutions.\n\nQuestions or tasks:\n1. Suppose I have a cabbage, a goat, and a lion, and I need to get them across a river. I have a boat that can only carry myself and a single other item. I am not allowed to leave the cabbage and lion alone together, and I am not allowed to leave the lion and goat alone together. How can I safely get all three across?"
