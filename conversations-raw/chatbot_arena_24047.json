      "content": "When a boy loves himself, he might have a strong sense of self-worth and confidence. This can lead to a more positive self-image, better decision-making, and healthier relationships with others. However, it's important to note that there is a difference between healthy self-love and narcissism. It's important to have a balanced view of oneself and to practice self-love in a way that does not harm oneself or others."
