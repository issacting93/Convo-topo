Instead, you can use the \"recycling symbol\" (♻) which has better support in older operating systems. The Unicode escape sequence for the recycling symbol is `'\\u2672'`.\n\nIn Windows 7, the \"Arial Unicode MS\" font supports the recycling symbol. To use this font in a text editor or application, simply select \"Arial Unicode MS\" as the font and enter the Unicode character using the escape sequence mentioned earlier.\n\nHere's an example in Python:\n\n```python\nrecycling_symbol = '\\u2672'\nprint(recycling_symbol)\n```\n\nThis will output the recycling symbol: ♻"
