      "content": "The probability of a player with ELO 700 to win over a player with ELO 800 would depend on various factors such as the skill level of the players, the game conditions, the strategies used by the players, etc. However, it is generally agreed that a player with ELO 700 has a better chance of winning than a player with ELO 800. The higher the ELO rating, the higher the player's skill level and the better their chances of winning."
