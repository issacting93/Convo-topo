She lied about it for a month, treated me like junk, but then started to become warmer and then said that we should stop communicating because she is betraying another man when becoming closer to me. I said that we can just talk and it will be ok. She agreed. Then we talked some days, she became indifferent, I got angry and blocked her everywhere. Was it smart move or I just gave up?"

      "content": "It is understandable to be angry and upset in this situation, but it may have been wiser to take a step back and give her time and space to sort out her feelings. It is possible that she was caught in the middle between her feelings for you and her love for another man, and that she was unsure how to resolve this internally. By blocking her everywhere, you have removed all possibility of communication, which may have been too drastic a step. It may have been better to give her some space and time, while still maintaining communication, to see if she was able to sort out her feelings."
