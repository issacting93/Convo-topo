      "content": "To convert Gaussian blur sigma into radius in pixels, you can use the following formulas:\n\n*   Sigma (sigma) is the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, and it determines the size of the blur.\n*   Radius (radius) is the radius of the blur, and it determines the maximum distance from the center of the blur that pixels will be affected.\n\nThe relationship between sigma and radius is:\n\nradius = sigma \\* 2\n\nSo, if you have a Gaussian blur with a sigma of 2, the radius will be 2 pixels.\n\nTo calculate the radius in pixels from the sigma value, you can use the formula:\n\nradius = sigma \\* 2\n\nFor example, if you have a Gaussian blur with a sigma of 2, the radius will be 2 pixels. If you have a Gaussian blur with a sigma of 4, the radius will be 4 pixels, and so on."

Then we define the number of unique uint64 numbers as 100k, and the Hamming distance threshold as 10. We then define the integers to check for Hamming distance less than or equal to the threshold as `` list(range(num_uint64s)) ``, which will generate a list of integers from 0 to 999999.\n\nWe then use a for loop to iterate over each uint64 number in the `` uint64s `` list. For each uint64 number, we use the `` hamming_distance_less_than_threshold `` list to find all integers that have a Hamming distance less than or equal to the threshold. The resulting list is then printed.\n\nNote that this code will be very slow and may take a long time to run, especially for large values of `` num_uint64s ``. You may want to optimize the code or use a library with more efficient algorithms, such as"

However, the time complexity will still be O(n^2), so it may take a long time to run for very large values of `` num_uint64s ``."
