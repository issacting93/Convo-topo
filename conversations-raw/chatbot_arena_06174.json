But I have a feeling that it's something like \"cyclical\" apartment cleaning, where the goal is to keep the air in the apartment by cleaning it.  There are specific kinds of chemicals you can buy that help with this.  The idea is that the air in the apartment is constantly getting exposed to the chemicals, which you can then use to \"clean\" it.  I think this is a good idea for a long term solution to the problem of air pollution."

I would want to do this if I had a problem with air pollution in my home.  I think the whole idea is that you're using a long term, chemical-free way to clean the air in the home, and that might help with air pollution.  It sounds like you might be using a specific product, but I wouldn't know the name.  I know that you can vacuum or sweep the floor to get the dust up there, but I don't know how that would help.  I'm not sure what you mean by \"manual cleaning\"."
