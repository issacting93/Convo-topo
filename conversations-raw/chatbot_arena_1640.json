One way to do this is to keep a record of your successes, whether they're big or small, and reflect on them regularly. This will help you stay motivated and remind you of your abilities and capabilities. Another way to do this is to remind yourself of your past successes whenever you're facing a new challenge or facing setbacks. This will help you stay positive and confident, which will in turn help you achieve even more in the future."

      "content": "One way to make this preference automatic is to write down your successes in a journal or notebook, and read them back over whenever you feel like you need a boost of confidence or motivation. You can also remind yourself of your successes by looking at photos or mementos from your past accomplishments. Another way to make this preference automatic is to surround yourself with positive and supportive people who encourage and celebrate your successes. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your accomplishments, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about what you hope to achieve in the future."
