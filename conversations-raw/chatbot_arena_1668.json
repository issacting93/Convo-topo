      "content": "Sure. Here is a simple algorithm in plain text that describes how you could decode a word that was encrypted with a Caesar cipher with shift of 21:\n\n1. Write out the alphabet twice, with the first alphabet shifted 21 places to the right.\n2. For each letter in the encrypted word, find the corresponding letter in the shifted alphabet.\n3. Write down the corresponding letter.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have decoded the entire word.\n\nFor example, if the encrypted word is \"XHQLO\", you would write out the alphabet twice as follows:\n\n```\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\nZYXWVUTSRQPONEMLKJIHGFEDCBA\n```\n\nThen, you would find the corresponding letter in the shifted alphabet for each letter in the encrypted word. For example, the letter \"X\" in the encrypted word corresponds to the letter \"A\" in the shifted alphabet. The letter \"H\" in the encrypted word corresponds to the letter \"M\" in the shifted alphabet. And so on.\n\nOnce you have found the corresponding letter for each letter in the encrypted word, you can write down the decoded word. In this case, the decoded word is \"HELLO\".\n\nHere is a table that shows the correspondence between the letters in the alphabet and the letters in the shifted alphabet:\n\n```\nPlaintext | Ciphertext\n------- | --------\nA | X\nB | Y\nC | Z\nD | AA\nE | AB\nF | AC\nG | AD\nH | AE\nI | AF\nJ | AG\nK | AH\nL | AI\nM | AJ\nN | AK\nO | AL\nP | AM\nQ | AN\nR | AO\nS | AP\nT | AQ\nU | AR\nV | AS\nW | AT\nX | AU\nY | AV\nZ | AW\n```"
