What is worse, if he leaves the wolf and the goat alone together, the wolf will eat the goat, and if he leaves the goat with the hay, the goat will eat the hay. How does he do it?\n\nSolve the riddle above by doing this task:\n1. Rewrite the task (riddle) to make it clear and easier to understand.\n2. Solve the riddle, but question every action multiple times to be sure the action is correct."

      "content": "1. A man needs to take a wolf, a goat, and some hay across a river. He can only take one thing at a time in his small boat. The wolf will eat the goat and the goat will eat the hay if left alone together. How does he get everything across safely?\n\n2. To solve this riddle, the man needs to follow these steps:\n\n- Take the goat across the river first, leaving the wolf and the hay on the original side.\n- Go back alone to the original side and take the wolf across the river, leaving the hay behind.\n- Bring the goat back to the original side, leaving the wolf on the other side.\n- Take the hay across the river next, leaving it on the other side with the wolf.\n- Finally, go back alone to the original side and take the goat across the river to the other side, where everything is safely reunited.\n\nIt is important to question each action to make sure it is correct. For example, the man must take the goat across first, not the hay or the wolf, otherwise the wolf or the goat will be left alone with the hay and eat it. Similarly, he must always bring the goat back to the original side before taking the hay or the wolf across, to avoid leaving the goat alone with either of them."
