You have always been there for me, through the good times and the bad, and I am so thankful for everything you have done for me. One specific memory that I will always cherish is the time we took a drive to the airport. It was early in the morning, and you had packed breakfast for us to enjoy on the road. We listened to our favorite music and chatted about everything and nothing at all. As we arrived at the airport, you hugged me tight and told me how proud you were of me. That moment will always stay with me, and I am so grateful to have had such a loving and supportive mother. Thank you for being an incredible mother, grandmother, and role model. I love you more than words can say."
