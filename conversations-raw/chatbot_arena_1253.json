The sentence is in the past tense and the word order is correct.\n* \"The cheap fabric of the plum-purple dress he wore piled on his hips and brushed roughly on his knees every step he took.\"\nHere, the subject is \"the cheap fabric of the plum-purple dress\", the verb is \"piled on his hips and brushed roughly on his knees\" and the object is \"every step he took\". The sentence is in the present participle and the word order is correct.\n\nIt is worth noting that the second sentence is a bit awkward in terms of word choice and phrasing, it could be rephrased in a more natural way."
