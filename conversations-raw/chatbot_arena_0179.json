Because if they had four, they would be a sedan!\n3. What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!\n4. Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!\n5. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised.\n\nI hope these jokes bring a smile to your face! Let me know if you would like me to send you some more."
