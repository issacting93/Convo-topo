      "content": "The Enigma machine had three key components.\nThe first key component was the rotor.\nThe rotor was a metal cylinder that had 26 individual electrical circuits.\nEach circuit could be set to represent a letter of the alphabet.\nThe first circuit was always set to the letter A.\nThe second circuit was always set to the letter B.\nThe third circuit was always set to the letter C.\nAll of the remaining circuits could be set to any letter.\nEach time a letter was typed, the Enigma machine would first send the typed letter to the first circuit, then to the second circuit, and so on.\nThe second key component was the plugboard.\nThe plugboard was a mechanism that allowed the user to customize the Enigma machine by rewiring the circuits.\nThe third key component was the reflector.\nThe reflector was a mechanism that allowed the user to rotate the rotor to the left or right.\nThe reflector would send the typed letter through the rotor once, then send it through the rotor again once more.\nThe reflector could be set to rotate to the left or to the right.\nThis resulted in the letter being encrypted in two different ways, and gave the Enigma machine its unbreakable encryption.\nThe rotor could be set to any letter in any order.\nThe plugboard could be set to any letter in any order.\nThe reflector could be set to rotate to the left or to the right.\nAll of these components together made the Enigma machine very complex and extremely difficult to crack."
