      "content": "Fan-in in software development refers to the number of inputs a single component receives from other components in a system. It is a measure of how much other components depend on a particular component. High fan-in can lead to complexity and difficulty in managing changes to the system."

This indicates that component A depends on three other components, B, C, and D, and that it passes its output to one other component, E."

      "content": "A minimal example in Python demonstrating fan-in and concurrency could be a system that consists of three threads, each performing a specific task. For example, thread A retrieves data from a database, thread B processes the data, and thread C sends the processed data to a client.\n\nIn this example, thread A has a fan-in of 1, as it only receives input from thread B. Thread B has a fan-in of 1, as it only receives input from thread C. However, thread C has a fan-in of 1, as it depends on the output of both thread A and thread B.\n\nThis system illustrates the issue of concurrency, as multiple threads are accessing shared resources, such as the database. This can lead to race conditions and other synchronization issues, which can be difficult to manage and debug."
