      "content": "That's great! Slack Bolt is a popular Python library for building Slack bots. Here are some resources that can help you get started:\n\n1. The Slack Bolt documentation is a great place to start. It covers everything from installing the library to building and deploying your bot. You can find it here: <https://pypi.org/project/slack-bolt/>\n2. The Slack Bolt examples repository is a great resource for seeing how other people have built bots using the library. You can find it here: <https://github.com/spullen/slack-bolt-examples>\n3. The Slack API documentation is also a valuable resource. It covers everything from the basic API endpoints to more advanced features like webhooks and reactions. You can find it here: <https://api.slack.com/docs/concepts>\n\nGood luck with your bot!"

      "content": "Sure, here's a simple Python script that uses the Slack Bolt library to handle app_mentions:\n```python\nimport os\nfrom slack_bolt import App\nfrom slack_bolt.adapter.socket_mode import SocketModeHandler\n\napp = App(token=os.environ[\"SLACK_APP_TOKEN\"])\n\n@app.event(\"app_mention\")\ndef handle_app_mention(event, say):\n    # Get the user who mentioned the app\n    mentioned_user = event[\"user\"]\n    mentioned_user_id = mentioned_user[\"id\"]\n\n    # Send a message back to the user thanking them for mentioning the app\n    response = \"Thanks for mentioning our app! We appreciate your feedback.\"\n    say(response, ephemeral=True, to=mentioned_user_id)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    handler = SocketModeHandler(app, os.environ[\"SLACK_APP_TOKEN\"])\n    handler.start()\n```\nThis script sets up an event listener for the `app_mention` event, which is triggered when someone mentions the app in a channel. When the event is triggered, the script gets the user ID of the person who mentioned the app and sends a message back to them thanking them for their feedback.\n\nNote that you'll need to replace `os.environ[\"SLACK_APP_TOKEN\"]` with your own Slack app token. Also, make sure you have the Slack Bolt library installed and imported correctly."
