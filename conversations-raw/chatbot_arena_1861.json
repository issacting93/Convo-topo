The`'#'`character is used to indicate that the data is not numeric, and it is not case-sensitive, so it can be used in many programming languages and frameworks.\nThe`'#'`character is used to indicate that the data is not numeric, and it is not case-sensitive, so it can be used in many programming languages and frameworks.\nThe`'#'`character is used to indicate that the data is not numeric, and it is not case-sensitive, so it can be used in many programming languages and frameworks.\nIn this example, the`Name`and`Score`fields are represented as strings, and the`Matches`field is represented as an integer."
