Here's a simple example of an API written in API:```php\nconst api = require('api');\nconst user = 'john.doe';\nconst password = 'password';\nconst timestamp = '2022-02-31 12:00:00';\nconst response = api.get('/user', user, timestamp);\nif (response.status === 200){ if (response.status === 200){  return response.body;\n} else{  return 200;\n}}```This API defines two methods,`get`and`update`, which can be used to retrieve the current date and time from a database. The`get`method retrieves a date and time object from a database, and the`update`method updates the specified date and time object in the response.\nTo use this API, you would make a GET request to the API endpoint (`/user`) with the necessary parameters, such as the date and time of the request. The API would then return the updated time object to the client in the response."
