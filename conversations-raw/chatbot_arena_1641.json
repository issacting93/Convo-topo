      "content": "Sure, here are 10 steps that are less and less similar to Tetris and more and more similar to Interstellar:\n\n1. Tetris\n2. A puzzle game\n3. A video game\n4. A science fiction film\n5. A film about space\n6. A film about time travel\n7. A film about the vastness of the universe\n8. A film about the importance of family\n9. A film about hope\n10. Interstellar\n\nAs you can see, the steps become more and more similar to Interstellar as we move down the list. This is because Interstellar is a film about space, time travel, the vastness of the universe, the importance of family, and hope. All of these things are also present in Tetris, albeit in a more abstract way. For example, the blocks in Tetris can be seen as representing planets, and the game's goal of clearing the screen can be seen as a metaphor for overcoming obstacles and achieving one's goals.\n\nUltimately, both Tetris and Interstellar are stories about the human condition. They explore themes of hope, perseverance, and the importance of family. Both films also offer a glimpse into the vastness of the universe and the mysteries that lie beyond our understanding."
