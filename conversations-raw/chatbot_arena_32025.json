      "content": "Yes \nThe application must manage the vacation days per year of each employee and show graphically the days that each employee has taken vacation and those that he/she has not taken yet.\nEach employee has x vacation days per year depending on his seniority.\nHe will use these days several times a year, for example employee 1 has 15 days of vacation per year but takes 7 days in the month of March from 01/03/23 to 08/03/23.\nThis means that the application can be updated frequently.\nWhat can arise is that when an employee has to take the scheduled vacation, he/she has a problem and has to reschedule his/her vacation for a later date."

      "content": "Thank you for the additional information. Based on your requirements, I propose the following application design:\n\n1. The application will have a database table to store employee information, including seniority (number of vacation days per year), and the current vacation days and time off for each employee.\n2. The application will have a graphical interface that displays the number of vacation days per year for each employee and the current number of vacation days taken and available for each employee.\n3. The application will allow the employee to request vacation days and be able to reschedule the date if necessary.\n4. The application will allow the manager to approve or reject the vacation request and the rescheduling request.\n5. The application will have a notification system that alerts the employee and the manager when a vacation request or rescheduling request is approved or rejected.\n6. The application will have a reporting system that generates reports on employee vacation days, usage, and rescheduling.\n\nThis application design is flexible and allows for frequent updates as needed. It also includes the necessary features to manage employee vacation requests and rescheduling, as well as reports for analysis and decision-making."
