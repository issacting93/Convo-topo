Here are a few options we could consider:\n\n1.   Climb over the fence: If the fence is high enough and we have the necessary climbing gear, we could try to climb over it.\n2.   Slip past the goons: If the goons are distracted or not paying attention, we could try to slip past them unnoticed.\n3.   Create a diversion: If the goons are focusing on us, we could create a diversion, such as by throwing a smoke bomb or setting fire to a nearby building, to draw their attention away from us.\n4.   Fight our way through: If the goons are too numerous or too well-armed, we may need to fight our way through. In this case, we would need to be prepared for a firefight and have the necessary weapons and skills to take them down.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific details of our actions will depend on the skills and abilities of our character, as well as the mission's objectives. As the player, you can decide how you want to proceed based on your character's backstory, motivations, and the resources available to them."
