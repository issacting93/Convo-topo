In this case, the word has 6 letters.\n3. Subtract 1 from the number of letters. In this case, since the 7th letter is \"p\", the correct answer is 6 - 1 = 5.\n4. Look at the 5th letter of the word. In this case, the 5th letter is \"p\".\n5. Write \"p\" on your paper or device to indicate the correct answer."
