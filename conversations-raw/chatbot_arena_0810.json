I think it has to do with the fact that many people tend to think of music in terms of language, and they may not be as familiar or comfortable with music in other languages. Additionally, many people associate certain eras and genres with a specific language, so they may not consider music in another language when making decisions about the \"best songs\" of a certain decade."

Additionally, certain songs can become popular across different countries due to international tours, international radio play, and digital streaming. The media may be reflecting on the popularity of certain songs in a specific region or country, but not taking into consideration the variety of music that people in other parts of the world listen to."
