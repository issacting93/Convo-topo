The final result is then returned at the end of the function.\n\nThis code is similar to the recursive version, but it uses a loop instead of recursion. The advantage of this approach is that it is simpler and easier to read, and it can be faster for small values of `` n ``. However, it can be slower for larger values of `` n ``, since it requires a loop to iterate over all the numbers in the sequence.\n\nOn the other hand, the recursive version is more concise and can be faster for larger values of `` n ``, since it uses a single function call for each number. However, it can be more difficult to understand and write, and it can cause a stack overflow if the sequence is very long."

If `` n `` is equal to 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies `` n `` to the result of recursively calling the function with `` n-1 ``. This process is repeated until the base case is reached (i.e., `` n `` is 1). The final result is then returned at the end of the function.\n\nRecursive functions can be more concise and easier to understand than non-recursive functions, but they can also be slower, since each function call requires a function call. In general, whether to use recursion or a loop will depend on the specific problem and desired behavior of the function."
