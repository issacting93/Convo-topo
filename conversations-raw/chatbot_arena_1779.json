Confused, he asked them what they were doing. \n\n\"We're exercising,\" replied one of the humans. \n\nThe alien was even more confused and asked, \"Why are you doing that?\" \n\n\"Well, you see, we humans have a tendency to eat a lot of unhealthy food, so we have to work out to stay healthy and fit,\" explained the human. \n\nThe alien was shocked and said, \"Let me get this straight. You eat unhealthy food knowing that it's bad for you, and then you have to work out to make up for it? That's quite an interesting concept!\""

As they were flying over a city, one of the aliens pointed at a tall building and asked their leader, \"What is that structure?\" \n\nThe leader replied, \"That's a skyscraper. Humans build them to touch the sky.\" \n\nThe aliens were amazed and decided to take a closer look. As they landed on the ground, they saw a group of humans staring at their phones and not paying attention to their surroundings. The aliens were puzzled and asked their leader, \"What are they doing?\" \n\nThe leader replied, \"Oh, those are just humans. They're always staring at their tiny screens, trying to communicate with each other.\" \n\nThe aliens looked at each other and said, \"How strange. They build skyscrapers to touch the sky, but they can't even look up to appreciate them.\""
