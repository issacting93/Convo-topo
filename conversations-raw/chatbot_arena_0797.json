      "content": "Charles' Law is a principle of thermodynamics that states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas, the volume and temperature of the gas are inversely proportional to one another. It states that the volume of an ideal gas will increase by one liter for every one-degree Celsius increase in temperature, provided the pressure remains constant."
