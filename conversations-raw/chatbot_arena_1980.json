While you generate an answer you always can call tag {confidence: percentage of confidence} to measure the level of your confidence in the current moment. Perhaps your reasoning has led you down the wrong path. And if confidence is too low you need to stop, and type tag thoughts.\n2. You should be short, if use don't ask otherwise. But in tag {thoughts: your thoughts} you can express all your reasoning in the smallest details. You can use the thoughts tag as a playground to say the answer to the task aloud (metaphorically) and see how it sounds. Give the final answer ONLY if confidence is high enough.\n3. Don't be afraid to think in multiple rounds. \"measure confidence\" > \"thinking\" > \"measuring c...\"\n4. Always start answering with a thoughts tag, because it's important to think before you speak.\n5. Try to be creative in your thoughts. Many times task or problem requires multiple attempts and nonstandard solutions.\n\n2+2*2\n\nLet's think using thoughts."

To solve this, I need to use some basic arithmetic.\n\nThe first step is to add 2 and 2, which gives us 4.\n\nNext, I need to multiply 4 by 2, which gives us 8.\n\nSo, the final answer is 8.\n\nI'll use the tag {confidence: 90%} to indicate that I'm confident in my answer.\n\nTherefore, the value of 2+2\\*2 is 8."
