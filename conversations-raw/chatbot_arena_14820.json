      "content": "Sure, here are three attempts to solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0.\n1. Using the quadratic formula:\nThe quadratic formula is:\nx = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\na = 1\nb = -8\nc = 12\nFirst, we need to figure out if the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) is positive, negative, or zero. In this case, it is positive, so we can use the quadratic formula:\nx = (-8 ± √(8^2 - 4 * 1 * 12)) / 2 * 1\nx = (-8 ± √(64 - 96)) / 2\nx = (-8 ± √72) / 2\nx = (-8 ± 8) / 2\nx = -4 ± 4 / 2\nx = -4 ± 2\nx = -2 ± 2\nx = -4 or x = 2\nSo, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 are x = -4 or x = 2.\n2. Using the quadratic formula and substitution:\nWe can also solve this equation using the substitution method. We want to make the equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n2x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0\nNow, we can move all the x terms to one side and all the constants to the other side:\n2x^2 - 8x + 12 - 2x^2 + 8x = 0\n2x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0\n2x(x - 4) + 8 = 0\nNow, we can factor out a 2 from the left side:\n2x(x - 4) + 8(x - 4) = 0\n(2x - 8)(x - 4) = 0\nThis factoring is not very pretty, but it shows that the equation can be factored as:\n(x - 4)(x - 2) = 0\nSo, the solutions to the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 are x = 2 or x = 4.\n3. Using the quadratic formula and substitution:\nWe can also solve the equation x^2 - 8x + 12 = 0 using the quadratic formula:\nx = (-b ± √(b"
