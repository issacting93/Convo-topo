First, I would ask you several questions regarding your current personal and professional situation to get a clear understanding of your current life context.  Second, I would have you describe a variety of nursing scenarios that you might find interesting or useful.  Third, I would ask you to think about how well you personally align with each of these scenarios and select the option that best describes how well you personally align with this nursing career.  This should give you an idea of whether or not this nursing career would be a good fit for you.  Good luck and hope this is helpful."

Here are some scenarios that you might find interesting or useful:\nScenario 1:  You are traveling in a remote area of a developing nation and come across a patient with a life threatening medical condition.  You are faced with a difficult choice, either you leave this patient to die and continue with your travel plans, or you stay and provide medical care beyond what is available in the local medical clinic.  Which of the following would you do?\n(A) I would stay to provide medical care beyond what is available in the local medical clinic.\n(B) I would leave this patient to die and continue with my travel plans.\n(C) I am not sure what would be the right choice in this situation.  It would depend on a lot of factors.\n(D) I would stay to provide medical care beyond what is available in the local medical clinic.  This is a life threatening condition and I should definitely stay to provide medical care.\n(E) I would leave this patient to die and continue with my travel plans.  This is a travel blog, so I should probably stop ruminating on hypothetical situations and get on with my life."

You receive a phone call from the emergency room informing you that a patient has been brought into the hospital in critical condition.  The patient has a medical condition that is usually easily managed, but this patient has been suffering from this condition for several days and has not shown any signs of improvement.  You are faced with a difficult choice, either transport this patient to the hospital in critical condition or allow this patient to die with their original medical condition.  Which of the following would you do?\n(A) I would immediately transport this patient to the hospital in critical condition.\n(B) I would allow this patient to die with their original medical condition.\n(C) I am not sure what would be the right choice in this situation.  It would depend on a lot of factors.\n(D) I would transport this patient to the hospital in critical condition.  This patient is in critical condition and needs immediate medical care.\n(E) I would allow this patient to die with their original medical condition.  It is their right to decide how they want to exit this life, and I should respect their decision.  I should not interfere with their choice."
