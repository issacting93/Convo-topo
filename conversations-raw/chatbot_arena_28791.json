It’s about a new technology that allows you to program robots to do many of the things that humans do. You can imagine a world where there are very few humans because a virus caused most people to get sick, and only a few robots to do all the work. The rest of the humans are either elderly or young children. The book sounds like it would be interesting, who wrote it?"

Her son, Oren, is one of the few robots who can do many of the things humans can do.  They are the only ones who can rebuild the civilization."

I love the area and the school district, so I bought this house.  I’m still looking for a job as a nurse, but it’s tough to get work right now.  Hopefully, I’ll find something before the little ones need me.  What about you?  Are you from around here?"
