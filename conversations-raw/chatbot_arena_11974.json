Then it uses another for loop to find the next number `` i `` that is greater than or equal to the value of `` N `` that can be divided by both `` 2 `` and `` 3 ``, and assigns it to the variable `` result ``.\n\nIf `` result `` is not equal to -1, it returns `` result ``, otherwise it returns 2.\n\nInput 1: 2\n\n\n```scss\nOutput: 1\n\n```\n\nInput 2: 10\n\n\n```scss\nOutput: 3\n\n```\n\nIt is worth mentioning that this solution has a time complexity of O(N) and space complexity of O(1) as we are not using any data structure."
