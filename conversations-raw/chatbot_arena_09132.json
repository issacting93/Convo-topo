      "content": "To find if two numerical series are correlated, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the two series. This will give you a value between -1 (negative correlation) and 1 (positive correlation).\n\n2. Determine the significance of the correlation between the two series. This is important because it means that the two series are not merely randomly fluctuating.\n\n3. If the correlation is significant, you can conclude that the two series are likely to be correlated. If the correlation is not significant, you can conclude that the two series are not likely to be correlated.\n\n4. You can also use statistical tests to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. A test such as the T test or the Z test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference between the two series that cannot be explained by chance."

      "content": "Yes, the same steps can be used to find if two numerical series are correlated with non-normally distributed data. However, the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient may not be suitable for non-normal data, as it assumes that the two series are normally distributed. In such cases, you may need to use different statistical tests or consider non-parametric tests that allow for non-normally distributed data."

      "content": "There are several alternative statistical tests that can be used for non-normally distributed data, depending on the specific research question and the type of data being analyzed. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test: This test can be used to compare the median values of two groups with a non-parametric test for equality. It is a non-parametric test that does not assume normality of the data.\n\n2. The Mann-Whitney U test: This test can be used to compare the median values of two groups with a non-parametric test for differences in distribution. It is a non-parametric test that does not assume normality of the data.\n\n3. The Kruskal-Wallis test: This test can be used to compare the median values of three or more groups with a non-parametric test for differences in distribution. It is a non-parametric test that assumes normality of the data.\n\n4. The Mann-Whitney U test with Hollande's correction: This test can be used to compare the median values of two groups with a non-parametric test for differences in distribution. It is a non-parametric test that assumes normality of the data.\n\n5. The Anderson-Darling test: This test can be used to compare the median values of two groups with a non-parametric test for differences in distribution. It is a non-parametric test that assumes normality of the data.\n\n6. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: This test can be used to compare the distribution of a sample of data with that of a known distribution. It is a non-parametric test that does not assume normality of the data.\n\nThese tests are not as robust as the other tests, but they can still provide valuable information in many cases. The choice of test depends on the specific research question and the nature of the data being analyzed."
