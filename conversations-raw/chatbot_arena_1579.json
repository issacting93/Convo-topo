      "content": "Yes, the 1890s were also a difficult time for the US economy. The Panic of 1893 was a severe economic depression that lasted for several years and was characterized by high unemployment rates, business failures, and bank runs. The depression was caused by a variety of factors, including overbuilding of railroads and factories, agricultural and labor problems, and a drop in silver prices. The depression lasted until the late 1890s and had a significant impact on the country's economic and political landscape."
