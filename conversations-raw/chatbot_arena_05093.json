      "content": "In Italian, you would say \"le studentesse francese\" because the noun \"studentesse\" is a feminine noun, and when you're referring to a nationality or a group of people, the noun must agree in gender with the noun it is modifying. \"Francese\" is a masculine noun, so it requires a feminine adjective to agree with the noun it modifies."

      "content": "In Italian, the plural form of a noun is often different from the singular form when the noun is a masculine or feminine noun. When the singular form ends in a consonant, the plural form will usually add an \"e\" to the end. However, when the singular form ends in a vowel, the plural form will usually drop the final consonant and add \"-i\" to the end.\n\nIn this case, \"francese\" is a masculine noun, so its singular form ends in a consonant. The plural form \"francesi\" is formed by adding the final \"e\" to the singular form, as is typical for masculine nouns in Italian.\n\n\"Francese\" is the singular form, \"francesi\" is the plural form."

For example, the plural form of the feminine noun \"studente\" (student) is \"studenti\" and the plural form of the feminine noun \"cena\" (dinner) is \"cene\"."
