      "content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an exact answer to your question as the data required to calculate the global statistical likelihood of a person meeting this precise criteria is not readily available. However, I can provide some estimates and general information.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, as of 2019, the global population was approximately 7.7 billion people. \n\nIn terms of the likelihood of a person being a Caucasian male in their 30s who is a Masters graduate and speaks English natively, this would depend on factors such as the country or region being considered, as well as the specific field of study in which the individual earned their Masters degree. It is also worth noting that the term \"Caucasian\" is a social construct and not a biological or scientific classification.\n\nFor the BMI range of 20 to 25, this would fall within the healthy weight range according to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the prevalence of individuals within this BMI range would also vary depending on the country or region being considered.\n\nIn summary, while I cannot provide an exact answer to your question, it is important to consider the various factors and regional differences that would impact the global statistical likelihood of a person meeting this precise criteria."

      "content": "The estimated global population of adult men with inattentive ADHD is difficult to determine as ADHD often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the worldwide prevalence of ADHD in adults is estimated to be 2.8%. It is also estimated that the inattentive subtype of ADHD is more common in adults than the hyperactive-impulsive subtype. Therefore, it can be assumed that a proportion of this 2.8% would have the inattentive subtype. However, it is important to note that the prevalence of ADHD and its subtypes can vary significantly by country, region, and population."
