      "content": ".NET Standard is a formal specification of .NET APIs that are intended to be available on all .NET implementations. It is a base set of APIs that are common across different .NET platforms, such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin. The primary goal of .NET Standard is to enable code sharing and provide a consistent set of APIs for developers to use when building libraries and applications that can run on multiple .NET platforms.\n\nIn other words, .NET Standard allows developers to create libraries and applications that can be used interchangeably across different .NET implementations, ensuring compatibility and reducing fragmentation in the .NET ecosystem. It helps to simplify the process of creating cross-platform applications and libraries, making it easier to maintain and share code across various platforms."

      "content": "To create a library that can be used by both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications, you need to target the lowest .NET Standard version that is compatible with both platforms. \n\nAs a general guideline:\n- .NET Core 1.0 to 3.1 supports .NET Standard versions 1.0 to 2.1.\n- .NET Framework 4.5 to 4.8 supports .NET Standard versions 1.0 to 2.0.\n\nTo maximize compatibility, you should target .NET Standard 2.0. This allows your library to be used by both .NET Framework (4.6.1 and later) and .NET Core (2.0 and later) applications. Keep in mind that targeting a lower .NET Standard version increases compatibility but may limit the available APIs you can use in your library.\n\nTo target a specific .NET Standard version, you need to set the `TargetFramework` element in your library's project file (csproj) to the corresponding version, like this:\n\n```\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n  ...\n</Project>\n```\n\nThis ensures that your library will be compatible with both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications that support the targeted .NET Standard version."
