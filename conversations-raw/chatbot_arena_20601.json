Some examples of good punchlines include:\n\n*   \"Why did the tomato turn red? Because it saw the salad dressing!\"\n*   \"Why did the chicken refuse to eat the hard-boiled egg? Because it didn't want to Eggle-stain its shirt!\"\n*   \"Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was out-standing in his field!\"\n*   \"Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two-tired.\"\n\nI hope these examples give you some inspiration for your own jokes!"
