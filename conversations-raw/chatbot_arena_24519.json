Thinking is a fundamental part of being human, and it is what allows us to navigate the world around us, make decisions, and problem solve. Without thinking, it would be difficult for a person to function in daily life."

      "content": "Many animals have the ability to think and problem solve in certain ways. For example, animals such as dolphins, elephants, and primates have been observed using complex communication methods, exhibiting self-awareness, and demonstrating the ability to plan for the future. However, the extent to which animals can think and problem solve is different from that of humans, as humans have developed a more advanced cognitive ability. Humans have the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn through language, which is not seen in the same way in animals."
