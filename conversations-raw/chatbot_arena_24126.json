Puppies are lovely and cuddly, and they seem to love everyone and everything. Fire hydrants, on the other hand, are just... there. They're not very photogenic, and they're always grumpy because they're unable to dance like the wind does."

This might be because old men have had more time to experience the wonders of the world, and have seen things that few humans have seen. These experiences make them wise and relatable, in addition to being cute. Puppies, on the other hand, are just adorable and cuddly. They might be small, but they can tackle anything with sheer volume of cuddlyness.old man cuter than puppy"
