The trap will consist of a cage made of strong wooden sticks, with a door that can be secured by a rope. The trap must be placed in a location where animals travel, such as near the edge of a forest or across a clearing. The trap will contain bait, such as a small piece of meat or fish. When an animal crawls into the cage to eat the bait, the door will be closed. The animal can then be captured and taken to a shelter."
