It is made up of a number of keys, each of which corresponds to a different letter or symbol. The keys are arranged in a QWERTY layout, which is the most common keyboard layout in the world.\r\n\r\nWhen you press a key on the keyboard, it sends a signal to the computer. The computer then interprets this signal and displays the corresponding letter or symbol on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe key that comes next on the keyboard after \"S\" is \"D\". However, if we are following the substitution cipher, then the next key that comes after \"S\" is \"H\"."
