      "content": "To create real-time computer-generated imagery (CGI) with 3D characters, you should consider learning the following:\n\n1. 3D modeling: You will need to be proficient in creating 3D models of characters, objects, and environments in a 3D modeling software such as Blender, Maya, or 3DS Max.\n2. Texturing: You will need to know how to texture your 3D models with materials such as skin, hair, and clothing.\n3. Rigging: You will need to know how to create skeletal structures for your characters so that you can animate them.\n4. Animation: You will need to know how to animate your characters using keyframe animation or motion capture.\n5. Rendering: You will need to know how to render your 3D scenes using a renderer such as V-Ray, Cycles, or Redshift.\n6. Real-time rendering: You will need to learn how to optimize your scenes for real-time rendering, which involves reducing the complexity of your models, textures, and animations to run smoothly on real-time platforms such as Unity or Unreal Engine.\n7. Programming: You will need to learn the basics of programming, specifically in C# or C++ if you are using Unity or Unreal Engine, respectively, to create the interactive elements of your real-time CGI.\n\nLearning these skills will give you the foundation you need to create real-time CGI with 3D characters. It is recommended to start with basic 3D modeling, texturing, and animation before diving into the more complex aspects of real-time rendering and programming."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "There are several cross-platform analogues of CUDA (NVIDIA's parallel computing platform) and ROCm (NVIDIA's software development kit for accelerating applications). Here are a few examples:\n\n1. OpenCL: OpenCL is a cross-platform, royalty-free API for parallel programming of heterogeneous systems. It is supported by both AMD and Intel, as well as other hardware vendors.\n2. Vulkan: Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API for high-performance graphics and compute. It is supported by both AMD and NVIDIA, as well as other hardware vendors.\n3. DirectX 12: DirectX 12 is a low-level API for Windows-based graphics and compute, developed by Microsoft. It supports parallelism and enables developers to directly access the GPU for maximum performance.\n4. Metal: Metal is a low-overhead API for graphics and compute on Apple platforms. It is designed to enable high-performance, direct access to the GPU on Apple devices.\n5. Renderscript: Renderscript is a cross-platform, low-level API for parallel computing on Android devices. It is supported by both Qualcomm and NVIDIA, and enables developers to write custom kernels for performance-critical tasks.\n\nEach of these platforms has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use will depend on the specific needs of the project and the hardware being used."
