Here are the steps to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, we can simplify the equation by cancelling out the x's in the 2x and 3x terms:\n\n2x + 3x = 10\n2x = 10 - 3x\n\nNext, we can solve for x by subtracting 3x from both sides:\n\n2x - 3x = 10 - 3x\n2x = 10\n\nFinally, we can divide both sides by 2 to get the solution for x:\n\nx = 10 / 2 = 5.\n\nSo the solution to the equation 2x + 3x = 10 is x = 5."
