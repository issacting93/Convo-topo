Additionally, it is not appropriate to make comments about someone's weight or to encourage them to change their body in order to fulfill the desires of others. Every person deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, regardless of their size or shape."

It is important to treat others with respect and kindness, regardless of their size or shape. It is also important to recognize that body size does not determine a person's worth or their ability to live a fulfilling life."
