      "content": "Apple is a publicly traded company, which means that its shares are owned by a large number of people and institutions, including individuals, mutual funds, pension funds, and other investment firms. As a result, it is not accurate to say that any one person or organization \"funds\" Apple.\n\nApple raises capital by issuing shares of stock and selling them to investors through stock exchanges. The company also generates revenue through the sale of its products and services. This revenue, along with any profits that the company earns, can be used to fund its operations, invest in new technologies, pay dividends to shareholders, and so on.\n\nIn summary, Apple is funded by a diverse group of investors who own its shares, as well as by the revenue that it generates from selling its products and services."

      "content": "The founder of Apple is Steve Jobs. He co-founded the company with Steve Wozniak in 1976. The two Steves started Apple in the garage of their friend, Paul Allen, with the goal of building personal computers that were easier to use and more accessible to the general public.\n\nAs for the question of whether funders or founders are greater, it really depends on the situation. In the case of Apple, both the founders and the investors played important roles in the company's success. The founders brought their vision and technical expertise to the table, while the investors provided the capital necessary to fund the company's growth and expansion.\n\nIn general, founders often play a key role in the early stages of a company's development, as they are typically the ones who come up with the original idea and are responsible for establishing the company's culture and direction. However, as a company grows and matures, the role of investors becomes increasingly important, as they provide the capital necessary to fuel expansion and innovation.\n\nUltimately, the contributions of both founders and investors are essential to the success of any company, and it is rare to see one without the other."
