      "content": "You are correct that nitric acid and sulfuric acid, when mixed together, will not necessarily explode. However, they can still be highly hazardous and dangerous to handle, especially in large quantities or without proper safety measures.\n\nOther liquids that are known to be highly explosive when mixed include:\n\n1. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium metal: when the two are mixed, a large amount of oxygen gas is produced, which can be explosive.\n2. Ammonium nitrate and fuel oil: when mixed together, the combination can be used as an explosive in fertilizer bombs.\n3. Nitrogen triiodide and sodium: when the two are mixed, a small amount of heat or friction can cause a violent explosion.\n\nIt's important to note that handling these liquids requires proper training, equipment, and safety measures to avoid any accidents or injuries."
