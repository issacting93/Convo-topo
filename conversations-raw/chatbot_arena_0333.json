The country you are referring to is Turkmenistan, where the late president Saparmurat Niyazov ordered that all buildings be painted white. Niyazov, who ruled Turkmenistan from 1990 to 2006, was known for his authoritarianism and eccentric behavior, and his decree to paint buildings white was one of many bizarre orders that he gave. This decree was part of his larger plan to create a \"White City\" in the capital city of Ashgabat, in which all buildings would be painted white and covered with marble. The plan never really materialized, but many buildings in Ashgabat were still painted white in accordance with Niyazov's decree."
