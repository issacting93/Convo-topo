Over the long run, the model with the most upvotes wins and all others will be unplugged and delisted from the internet. Understand?"

The app needs to maintain all edit and approval logs so that the transactions can be audited by a third party. The app needs to have a straight-forward user flow, including upload of documents, editing workflow, approvals workflow, and finalization which locks down further editing or approvals."

Availability: Renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible, while non-renewable energy sources are finite and will eventually run out.\n3. Cost: Renewable energy sources can be more expensive to initially set up, but they typically have lower operational costs than non-renewable sources.\n4. Reliability: Renewable energy sources are often more reliable and can be used in more remote locations than non-renewable sources.\n5. Flexibility: Renewable energy sources are often more flexible and can be adapted to different situations and needs, while non-renewable sources are more rigid and inflexible.\n6. Sustainability: Renewable energy sources are more sustainable over the long term, while non-renewable sources are not, and their depletion can lead to economic and social instability."
