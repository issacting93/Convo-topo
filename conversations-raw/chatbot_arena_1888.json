The visa will allow you to stay in Sinai for a limited period of time. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Israeli government currently advises against all non-essential travel to the Sinai Peninsula due to security concerns. It is recommended that you follow the travel advice provided by your government and exercise caution if you do decide to travel to Sinai. \n\nYou may also want to check with the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv or with a travel agency to confirm the latest visa requirements and travel restrictions before planning your trip."
