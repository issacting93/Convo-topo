      "content": "I struggle with learning things, whenever I sit down to learn a boring (that will stop being boring long term) subject like mathematics or chemistry, after 15 or so minutes I get almost painfully uncomfortable and start to run away with my thoughts to different more exciting ideas. I want to learn more diligently, for longer, minimizing breaktime, how could I manage that?"

      "content": "It's normal to feel uncomfortable when learning something new, especially if it's a subject that doesn't immediately interest you. There are a few things you can try to help you manage this behavior and improve your ability to learn for longer periods of time:\n\n1.   Take breaks: It's important to take breaks when learning to give your brain a chance to process and absorb the information. However, try to keep your breaks short and focused, so you can get back to learning as quickly as possible.\n2.   Find a good study environment: It's important to have a comfortable and quiet study environment when learning. This can help you focus and concentrate on the material.\n3.   Set a specific study schedule: Setting a specific study schedule can help you stay focused and motivated. Try to study for a set amount of time each day, and stick to your schedule as much as possible.\n4.   Find a study buddy: Having a study buddy can be helpful for many reasons. It can provide you with motivation and accountability, and can also be a good source of support and encouragement.\n5.   Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, charts and maps can help to make the material more engaging and memorable.\n6.   Practice active learning: Engaging in active learning such as reading, summarizing, questioning, discussing and practicing can help to improve your ability to learn and retain information.\n7.   Find a way to make the material interesting to you: If you find the material hard to be interested in, try to think of ways to make it more interesting to you. This can be as simple as finding a different perspective or looking for a connection to something that you already find interesting.\n8.   Set a goal: Setting a goal can be a powerful motivator. Try to set a goal for yourself, such as learning a certain number of pages or a specific topic, and work towards it."

I already have a long term goal as well as short term minigoals, my study environment is good and I tried pomodoro techicque and it didn't really work out (I struggle a lot to return to learning after the short break) I would really enjoy (conceptually) to sit dilligently and soak up as much information as I can but I feel my body is working against me with that aspirations, due to the nature of the subjects I study almost every source is a dry-ish text and doing flashcards would be unpractical."

Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, charts and maps can help to make the material more engaging and memorable.\n2.   Use active recall: Engaging in active recall such as trying to recall the material without looking at your notes, or trying to explain the material to a friend or family member can help to improve your ability to remember and retain information.\n3.   Practice chunking: Chunking is the process of breaking down the material into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can help you to process the material more easily and can also make it easier to remember.\n4.   Use mnemonics: Mnemonics are memory aids that can be used to remember lists of items. This can be useful for remembering complex lists of terms or concepts.\n5.   Find a way to make the material interesting to you: If you find the material hard to be interested in, try to think of ways to make it more interesting to you. This can be as simple as finding a different perspective or looking for a connection to something that you already find interesting.\n6.   Use spaced repetition: Spaced repetition is a memory aid technique where you review material at increasingly longer intervals. This can help you to remember and retain the material longer.\n7.   Use audio books: Audio books can be a good option if you find that reading is difficult for you. This way you can listen to the material while doing something else.\n8.   Find a study buddy: Having a study buddy can be helpful for many reasons. It can provide you with motivation and accountability, and can also be a good source of support and encouragement.\n9.   Find a way to make studying more enjoyable: Finding ways to make studying more enjoyable can help you to stay motivated and engaged. This can be as simple as listening to music, or as elaborate as seting up a study space with your favorite things.\n10.   Practice active listening: Engaging in active listening such as asking questions, summarizing, and reacting to the material can help you to improve your ability to retain information.\n\nIt is important to note that everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another. It might take some trial and error to find what works best for"
