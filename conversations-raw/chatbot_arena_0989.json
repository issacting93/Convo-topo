As you know, the due date was [date of the invoice].\n\nI understand that you may be inconvenienced by this, but it is important that you follow the payment schedule we have agreed upon. Late payment can have serious consequences for our business relationship, and it is not in our best interests.\n\nI would be happy to discuss how we can work together to make up for the late payment, but please let me know if you have any concerns or questions.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n```\n\nThis email is a general example and you can tailor it to your specific needs and circumstances. The important thing is to be clear, concise and respectful in your communication with your customer."
