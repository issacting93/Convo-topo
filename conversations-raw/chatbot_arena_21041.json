As the brand’s website states, it aims to ‘explore new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species’. Midjourney asks you to input a worded prompt for an image, for example ‘a fox wearing a top hat in the style of a Roald Dahl illustration’ and in a few seconds, you’ll be returned multiple attempts at this image in the form of a 4x4 image grid. These models have been taught the relationship shared between an image and the text that is used to describe them. The team behind Midjourney are now on the fifth iteration (V5). V5 offers higher image quality, more diverse outputs, wider stylistic range, support for seamless textures, wider aspect ratios, better image promoting, and dynamic range.\nMidjourney V5 Prompt Guide:\nTo use Midjourney V5, add the --v 5 parameter to the end of a prompt. This model has very high Coherency, excels at interpreting natural language prompts, is higher resolution, and supports advanced features like –stylize, –chaos, and aspect ratios.\nIn --v 5, to generate something other than a photographic image, you will need to reference art movements, artistic techniques, genres, media type, games titles, directors, artist names, influences, time periods, etc. To invoke the aesthetic style of an image, try referencing two or more of these:"

The nail is visible as an object, while the flame is a backdrop and the Bunsen burner is the subject. The sketch should capture the sensation of the nail being heated and the resulting heatwave that follows, along with the visual effects of the flame. Use oil paint or a digital art tool to create the sketch.\""
