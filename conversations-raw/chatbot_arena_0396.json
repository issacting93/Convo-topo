      "content": "Sure, I can create a human, male character based on the Bandersnatch. He will have a tall and lean body, with a thin mustache and dark eyes. He will wear a brown coat and a black hat. He will be an introverted and thoughtful person, who enjoys spending time alone in the woods. He will have a gentle and caring nature, but he will also have a fierce protective streak when needed. He will be an independent spirit, who lives by his own rules and isn't afraid to take risks. He will be an outsider, who doesn't always fit in, but he will always remain true to himself."

He will have a strong, chiseled jawline and a warm, inviting smile. He will be a smart, confident man who isn't afraid to show his emotions. He will be a successful businessman, but he still finds time to relax and enjoy the simple things in life. He will be an attentive and thoughtful partner, who will shower his love interest with care and attention. He will be a passionate lover, who will be eager to explore and discover new sensations together. He will be the perfect, romantic leading man."
