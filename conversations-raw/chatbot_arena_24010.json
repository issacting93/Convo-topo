      "content": "The title \"Study: Anxiety Resolved By Thinking About It Real Hard\" is funny because it plays on the idea of \"trying hard\" as a way to solve problems. This implies that anxiety can be reduced by thinking hard about it, which is not necessarily the case. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the serious nature of anxiety and the absurdity of the idea of trying to solve it with mental effort."

      "content": "It is likely that constant thinking about issues that worry a person will make their anxiety worse. This is because excessive worrying can increase stress and anxiety levels, which can lead to further negative thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, worrying can divert attention from more productive activities and can interfere with sleep.\n\nOn the other hand, it is possible that constant thinking about issues that worry a person can lead to some relief from anxiety. This is because worrying can act as a form of self-talk, providing a way to process and organize thoughts and feelings. Additionally, thinking about issues that worry a person can help to clarify their thoughts and feelings, which can be useful in reducing anxiety.\n\nIt is important to note that excessive worrying can be a sign of an underlying mental health issue, and it is recommended to seek the help of a mental health professional if you are experiencing significant anxiety."
