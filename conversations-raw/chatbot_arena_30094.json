      "content": "Here are simple instructions for brushing your teeth:\n\n1. Gather your supplies: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash (optional)\n\n2. Wet your toothbrush and apply a small amount of toothpaste. For most adults, a pea-sized amount of toothpaste is enough.\n\n3. Hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to your gums. Gently brush your teeth in small, circular motions. Brush all surfaces of your teeth - front, back, top, and sides.\n\n4. Pay extra attention to brush along your gum line and hard-to-reach areas in the back of your mouth. Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. \n\n5. Brush for at least two minutes to ensure you've thoroughly cleaned your teeth. You can set a timer to help keep track of time. \n\n6. Rinse your mouth with water to remove any remaining debris. Then floss between all teeth to remove any food particles and plaque.\n\n7. Rinse with mouthwash (if using). Swish the mouthwash around your mouth for at least 30 seconds then spit it out. \n\n8. Your teeth should feel smooth and clean when done. Brush and floss your teeth at least twice per day, ideally after waking up and before bed. Brushing and flossing regularly help prevent tooth decay and gum disease.\n\n9. Change your toothbrush every 3-4 months or sooner if the bristles become frayed. Worn-out toothbrushes won't clean your teeth effectively.\n\nThat covers the basic steps for brushing your teeth properly. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
