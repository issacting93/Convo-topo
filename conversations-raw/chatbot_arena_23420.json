The team that wins the World Cup is determined by a combination of factors, including the performance of their players, the tactics they employ, and the strength of their squad, and it is not possible for me to accurately predict which team will win."

I can tell you that both China and the United States are strong teams that have the potential to win the World Cup. The performance of their players, the tactics they employ, and the strength of their squad all play a role in determining which team will win. It is difficult to predict which team will come out on top in the final, as it will depend on a variety of factors."

The winning margin for each team has varied over the years, but generally, teams that have won the tournament in the past have been considered to be strong candidates for the upcoming tournament."
