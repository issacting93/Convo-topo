      "content": "You are right, the 12% calculation should be (12% of £18,000) x £18,000 = £2,160. So the value of the car after 5 years is:\n£18,000 - (25% of £18,000) - (12% of £18,000) - (12% of £18,000) - (12% of £18,000) = £2,160. \nThe average of these 5 values is:\n(£18,000 + £17,500 + £17,125 + £17,025 + £2,160) / 5 = £17,965.\nTherefore, the value of the car after 5 years is £17,965."
