      "content": "Sure, here's the derivation of the softmax function:\n\nGiven a vector of scores $Z = [z_1, z_2, ..., z_k]$, the softmax function is given by:\n\n$\\sigma(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}$\n\nTo find the derivative of the softmax function, we can start by taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator separately:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial e^{z_i}}{\\partial z_i} = e^{z_i}$\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}{\\partial z_i} = e^{z_i}$\n\nUsing the quotient rule of differentiation, we can find the derivative of the softmax function:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma(z_i)}{\\partial z_i} = \\frac{e^{z_i} \\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j} - e^{z_i} e^{z_i}}{(\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j})^2}$\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n$\\frac{\\partial \\sigma(z_i)}{\\partial z_i} = \\sigma(z_i) (1 - \\sigma(z_i))$\n\nAnd here's a related math joke:\n\nWhy was the math book sad? Because it had too many problems."

In the softmax function, the sigma notation is used to represent the summation of the exponential values in the denominator. In the sigmoid function, the sigma notation is used to represent the logistic function. \n\nFor example, the sigmoid function is given by:\n\n$\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$\n\nAnd the equation can be written using the sigma notation as:\n\n$\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^i z^i}{i!}}$\n\nSimilarly, the softmax function is given by:\n\n$\\sigma(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}}$\n\nAnd the equation can be written using the sigma notation as:\n\n$\\sigma(z_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{z_j}} = \\frac{e^{z_i}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\sigma(z_j)}$"
