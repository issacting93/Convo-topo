      "content": "As an AI language model, I do not have the ability to test code in real time. However, I can provide you with some examples of how you can test PHP functions in real time using the `phpunit` command line tool or command-line interface (CLI).\n\nTo test a PHP function using the CLI, you can execute it using the `phpunit` command with the `-r` option, which runs the PHP unit tests in a separate directory. For example:\n```\nphpunit test-function.php -r\n```\nYou can also use the `phpunit` command to execute a function with a specific input and output, and then use the `-p` option to specify the output file:\n```\nphpunit test-function.php -p output.txt\n```\nThis will run the test and output the results to the `output.txt` file.\n\nAnother option is to use a testing framework like `PHPUnit` or `TestNG`. These frameworks provide a set of pre-defined test cases and functions that you can use to test your code in a more organized and efficient way.\n\nPlease keep in mind that running tests on your server, or on a remote machine that your server is connected to, may not be the best practice. It is generally better to test your code on a development or staging environment before running it in production."
