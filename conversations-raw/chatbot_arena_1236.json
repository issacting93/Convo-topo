Historically, the Celtics have won 17 NBA championships, while the Lakers have won 17 as well. Both teams have had numerous star players and memorable moments throughout their histories.\n\nThe \"better\" team can vary from season to season, and personal preference often plays a role in which team fans consider to be better. Some fans may prefer the Lakers' style of play or their famous players, while others may prefer the Celtics for their rich history and team culture. Ultimately, the better team depends on individual opinions and the specific time frame being considered."
