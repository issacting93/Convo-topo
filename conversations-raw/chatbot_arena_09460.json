      "content": "The sky appears blue because of the way Earth's atmosphere scatters sunlight. When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it is made up of all colors of light. However, the gas molecules and other tiny particles in the atmosphere are more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet. \n\nAs these shorter wavelengths are scattered in all directions, our eyes perceive the sky as predominantly blue. We don't see much violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and also because some of the violet light gets absorbed by the ozone layer."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "During sunset, the sun is lower in the sky, which means sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes. As it travels through the atmosphere, most of the shorter wavelengths of light, like blue, get scattered away. This leaves the longer wavelengths, like red, orange, and yellow, to continue their journey towards us. As a result, we see the sky and sun appearing red or orange during sunset."
