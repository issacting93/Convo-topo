      "content": "The most effective way to quickly get over jet lag is to stay in a consistent time zone. This means that you should keep yourself awake with activities that are stimulating and easy to do, such as reading, exercising, or watching TV. Additionally, drinking plenty of water and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can help you feel more alert and less groggy during the first few days of adjusting to the new time zone. It is also important to allow your body time to adjust to the new time zone, so that your circadian rhythm can begin to adjust to the new time zone as well. Finally, it can be helpful to try to be as active and engaged as possible during the first few days of adjustment, to help your body get used to being awake in the new time zone."

      "content": "If you are on a plane, you can certainly limit your flight time by adjusting your seatmates and your seat so that you have the best view of the runway. However, you should be cautious about doing this too often as this can make you feel cramped and uncomfortable, as well as potentially disorienting. It is also important to be aware of the demands of the flight, and to try to avoid disrupting other passengers by being overly disruptive on the plane. In general, it is best to avoid doing anything that will make you feel uncomfortable, such as tapping your feet, talking loudly, or making eye contact with other people."
