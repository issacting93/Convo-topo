      "content": "The best way to cook salmon is to grill it or smoke it. It is also good baked or roasted. If you are planning on smoking your salmon, use this basic recipe for a simple smoke flavor. \n\n1) Combine 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper in a ziplock bag. Add the salmon and marinate in the bag for at least 30 minutes.\n\n2) Prepare a hickory smoke with cherry wood and smoke the salmon until it reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees."
