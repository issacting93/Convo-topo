Assign User1 the Website Contributor role for Contoso2022.\n\nThe Website Contributor role has the ability to create additional deployment slots for the website, so this is the appropriate role to assign to User1 in this scenario.\n\nHere's how you can assign the Website Contributor role to User1:\n\n1. Go to the Azure portal and navigate to the Contoso2022 web service.\n2. Click on the \"Administration\" section in the left-hand menu.\n3. Click on the \"Security\" tab.\n4. Click on the \"Add role assignments\" button.\n5. In the \"Roles\" section, select \"Website Contributor\".\n6. In the \"Assign role to\" section, type in \"User1\" (or the name of the user you want to assign the role to) and click \"Add role assignment\".\n7. Click \"OK\" to save the changes.\n\nAfter you have assigned the Website Contributor role to User1, they will be able to create additional deployment slots for Contoso2022."

This plan size is suitable for web apps that do not require a high level of performance or scalability, and is a cost-effective solution for small to medium-sized web apps.\n\nHere's a summary of the other options:\n\n1. \"Dev/Test F1\" app service plan size: This plan size is intended for small, lightly-trafficked web apps and provides a small amount of compute and memory resources. This plan size is not suitable for web apps that require a high level of performance or scalability.\n2. \"Production P1V2\" app service plan size: This plan size is intended for production web apps that require a high level of performance and scalability. This plan size provides a large amount of compute and memory resources, but is also the most expensive option.\n3. \"Production P3V3\" app service plan size: This plan size provides more compute and memory resources than the \"Production P1V2\" plan size, but is still intended for production web apps that require a high level of performance and scalability.\n4. \"Isolated I1V2\" app service plan size: This plan size provides a balanced set of compute and memory resources for testing and development scenarios, but with the added benefit of isolated scaling resources. This plan size is suitable for web apps that require a high level of isolation between instances, but may be more expensive than the \"Dev/Test B1\" plan size.\n\nIn summary, if you want to minimize costs and still have enough resources to run your web app, you should use the \"Dev/Test B1\" app service plan size for WebApp1."
