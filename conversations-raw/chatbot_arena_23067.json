      "content": "From your statement, it sounds like Tabitha may have done something to cause you distress or unhappiness for a 2-year period, but without more details I can't say exactly what happened. Some possibilities could be:\n\n- Tabitha bullied or teased you for 2 years when you were younger before you were able to stand up to her or the situation resolved in some other way. \n\n- Tabitha went through a difficult phase (e.g. behavioral issues, substance abuse problem, mental health crisis) for 2 years that caused problems for you or your family.\n\n- You had to live with or care for Tabitha for 2 years during a time when she was unwell or struggling in some way.\n\n- There was a 2-year period where you and Tabitha didn't get along or were fighting/arguing frequently, causing stress.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact situation and relationship with Tabitha, I can only speculate. The key clue is that something Tabitha did or that involved Tabitha caused you distress for a period of 2 years. But you would need to provide more details in order for me to determine exactly what happened.\n\nDoes this help explain my reasoning? Let me know if you can provide any additional details or context."

      "content": "Ah I see, with this additional context it sounds like my initial interpretations were incorrect. If you were actually very happy for those 2 years, then a more likely explanation could be:\n\n- Tabitha moved away, went off to college or moved out of the house for 2 years, and you missed her during that time. Now that she's back, you feel like you lost out on 2 years you could have spent with her.\n\n- There was an age difference of 2 years between you and Tabitha that prevented you from doing certain activities together for a period of time. But now that she's older you regret not having had those additional 2 years to build your relationship. \n\n- Tabitha went through a phase (e.g. \"rebellious teen years\") for 2 years where she was distant or pulling away from family, but now your relationship is closer again. You feel like you missed out on strengthening your bond during those 2 years.\n\n- Simply due to the normal ups and downs of life and relationships, you and Tabitha weren't as close for 2 years but have since reconnected, and you wish you had made more of an effort to stay close during that time.\n\nIn summary, it sounds like your statement was expressing regret over lost time with Tabitha, rather than distress caused by her actions. The sentiment seems to be that you value your relationship with her, and wish you had those 2 years back to strengthen your bond, rather than viewing them as \"lost\" or unhappy years.\n\nDoes this make sense? Let me know if I'm still off in my interpretation or if I can provide any other insights!"

      "content": "Ah I see, now the full picture is coming into focus. Given this new information, it seems clear now that:\n\nYou were in a happy romantic relationship with Tabitha for 2 years. \nDuring that time, you discovered that Tabitha was cheating on you. \nYou ended the relationship upon discovering her infidelity.\nYou now regret those 2 years you spent with her, because you were betrayed and the relationship ended up being built on dishonesty.\n\nThe sentiment \"2 years I'm never getting back\" expresses regret over the time and emotional investment you put into that relationship, only to have Tabitha cheat and break your trust. Though the years were happy at the time, in hindsight you feel they were wasted once her deception came to light.\n\nThis is understandably an upsetting situation, and it's normal to feel regret, anger or sadness over the lost time and heartbreak. But the silver lining is that you discovered the truth, ended an unhealthy relationship, and can now move forward to find a more honest and committed partner when you're ready.\n\nThough painful, this experience likely taught you some valuable lessons about relationships and trusting your instincts. And over time, those angry/regretful feelings should fade, as you build happier memories with someone new.\n\nPlease let me know if this interpretation resonates with you, or if you have any other thoughts you'd like to share. I wish you the very best in healing from this experience and finding a healthy, loving relationship when the time is right."
