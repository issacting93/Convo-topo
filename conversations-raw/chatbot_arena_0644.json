      "content": "In Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the story ends with the destruction of Captain Nemo's submarine, the Nautilus.\n\nNear the end of the book, the Nautilus is attacked by a warship while submerged. Nemo is able to destroy the warship, but the Nautilus sustains significant damage. The submarine starts taking on water and will soon sink.\n\nNemo allows the novel's protagonist, Professor Aronnax, and his two companions to leave the Nautilus aboard a small boat. Before they depart, Nemo reveals that his real name is Prince Dakkar, and that he built the Nautilus to roam the seas free from human interference.\n\nAs Aronnax and his friends escape, they watch as the Nautilus releases a bright flash under the water and then explodes. Captain Nemo and his crew perish as the Nautilus is destroyed.\n\nAronnax and his companions are eventually rescued by a passing ship. In the end, Aronnax struggles with the loss of Nemo and the Nautilus, and reflects on his amazing adventures under the sea.\n\nSo in summary, the story ends with the destruction of the Nautilus, the death of Captain Nemo, and Aronnax returning to land to recount his extraordinary voyage 20,000 leagues under the sea.\n\nIt's a bittersweet ending, but with the sense that Aronnax will keep the memory of Captain Nemo and his wondrous submarine alive through the stories he shares with the world."
