The cat was not so sure - but since the dog was so excited, she decided to go along for the ride. So, the two of them hopped in the tub, and the dog started to play with the water, while the cat watched curiously from the side. After a few moments, they both realized that this was much more fun than they had expected, and they continued to have a great time - much to the surprise of both the dog and cat!"
