      "content": "Here are the steps for a Hangman game:\n\n1.   User inputs a word they want to guess.\n2.   Game generates a random list of letters in the word.\n3.   User attempts to guess the letters of the word.\n4.   If the user guesses a correct letter, it is added to the word list. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, the game displays \"Invalid word. Please try again.\"\n5.   The game repeats steps 2-4 until the user guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.\n6.   If the user guesses the entire word correctly, the game prints \"Congratulations! You won!\" If the user runs out of lives before guessing the entire word, the game prints \"Game Over!\"."
