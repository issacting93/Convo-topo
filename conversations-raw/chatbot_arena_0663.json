Going home, she indulged in her sweet treats. Just then, a knock at the door interrupted her sugar high. Kneading her forehead, Amy answered the door. \"Look who's here!\" exclaimed her best friend, Mary. Now they could enjoy the candy together. Obviously, Amy was thrilled. Perfectly content, the two friends laughed and chatted away. Quickly, the evening flew by. Running out of candy, they said their goodbyes and planned their next get together. So ended Amy's happy day."
