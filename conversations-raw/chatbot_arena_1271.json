      "content": "Depleted uranium has a mass of 238.9 atomic mass units (amu) and a density of approximately 7.87 g/cm^3. A pound of depleted uranium has a mass of 238.9 amu and a volume of 28.79 cm^3.\n\nA pound of feathers has a mass of about 1.1 kilograms (2.2 pounds) and a volume of about 0.24 cubic meters (1 cubic foot).\n\nTherefore, a pound of depleted uranium is about 7.4 times heavier than a pound of feathers."

      "content": "Since we are comparing the same units of measure (pounds), we could disregard the materials altogether. We could then compare the mass of the depleted uranium to the mass of the feathers, which is easier to calculate using standard units. The depleted uranium is approximately 7.4 times heavier than the feathers."
