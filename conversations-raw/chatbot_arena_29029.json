The G8 meet periodically to discuss issues of importance to member states and agree upon measures to address these issues. The countries that comprise the G8 have been experiencing slow economic growth in recent years, and this is an important topic to be discussed at the next meeting of G8 Finance Ministers. In preparation for this meeting, a McKinsey team, working together with a group of external thought leaders and academics, are preparing a report on the importance of Innovation as a contributor to economic growth. The team intends to introduce a concept to the G8 representatives known \nas ‘Innovation Capital’, which is the value of all innovation-related assets which contribute to growth in productivity in the economy.\n\nThe team further defines three types of Innovation Capital:\n1. Physical Capital: Investments in information and communication equipment\n2. Knowledge Capital: Investments that build the intellectual property and brand value of a company or organization\n3. Human Capital: Investments that build individual or group abilities and skills within companies or organizations\nTable 1. below shows the main components of Innovation Capital and their total value across 16 countries that the team has been studying, including the members of the G8. \n|Subitem of Innovation Capital|Total Value(US$, trillions)|\n|---|---|\n|Information and communications infrastructure|2.2|\n|Computerized information|1.2|\n|Scientific research and development|3.2|\n|Other research and development|3.3|\n|Advertising and market research|0.6|\n|Education|1.1|\n|Employee development|0.7|\n|Organizational development|1.5|\nTotal Innovation Capital equals 13.8 trillion USD, by sum up all subitems of innovation capital. \nAre you ready to answer some questions? \""
