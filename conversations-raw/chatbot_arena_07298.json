      "content": "If you want to make a simple sandwich, start by placing your favourite bread on a clean surface. Next, add your favourite condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, or pickles. Then, add your fillings, such as ham, turkey, or cheese. Finally, add any toppings you like, such as lettuce, tomatoes or pickled vegetables. Make sure the fillings are evenly spread out and the bread is covered. To make it more interesting, you can add some fresh herbs or sliced vegetables like lettuce or cucumber. And that's it, your simple sandwich is ready to be enjoyed!"

      "content": "Toasting bread before adding fillings is a great way to add texture and depth of flavour to your sandwich. Here's how you can toast bread:\n1. Preheat a toaster or a non-stick pan on low heat.\n2. Brush each side of the bread with a little bit of oil or butter.\n3. Place the bread in the toaster or pan and toast for a few minutes, until the bread is golden brown and crispy.\n4. Remove the bread from the toaster, pan or oven, and let it cool for a few minutes.\nYou can use any type of bread for this step, but I suggest using a crusty bread like sourdough or ciabatta for a better crunch. Try experimenting with different types of bread and toppings to find your favourite combination."
